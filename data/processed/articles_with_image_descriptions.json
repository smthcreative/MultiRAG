        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 326\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nAI agents are getting better at looking at different types of data in businesses to spot patterns and create value. This is making data silos increasingly painful. This is why I increasingly try to select software that lets me control my own data, so I can make it available to my AI agents.\nBecause of AI’s growing capabilities, the value you can now create from “connecting the dots” between different pieces of data is higher than ever. For example, if an email click is logged in one vendor’s system and a subsequent online purchase is logged in a different one, then it is valuable to build agents that can access both of these data sources to see how they correlate to make better decisions.\nUnfortunately, many SaaS vendors try to create a data silo in their customer’s business. By making it hard for you to extract your data, they create high switching costs. This also allows them to steer you to buy their AI agent services — sometimes at high expense and/or of low quality — rather than build your own or buy from a different vendor. Unfortunately, some SaaS vendors are seeing AI agents coming for this data and working to make it harder for you (and your AI agents) to efficiently access it.\nOne of my teams just told me that a SaaS vendor we have been using to store our customer data wants to charge over $20,000 for an API key to get at our data. This high cost — no doubt intentionally designed to make it hard for customers to get their data out — is adding a barrier to implementing agentic workflows that take advantage of that data.\nThrough AI Aspire (an AI advisory firm), I occasionally advise businesses on their AI strategies. When it comes to buying SaaS, I often advise them to try to control their own data (which, sadly, some vendors mightily resist). This way, you can hire a SaaS vendor to record and operate on your data, but ultimately you decide how to route it to the appropriate human or AI system for processing.\nOver the past decade, a lot of work has gone into organizing businesses’ structured data. Because AI can now process unstructured data much better than before, the value of organizing your unstructured data (including PDF files, which LandingAI’s Agentic Document Extraction specializes in!) is higher than ever before.\nIn the era of generative AI, businesses and individuals have important work ahead to organize their data to be AI-ready.\nKeep building,\nAndrew\nP.S. As an individual, my favorite note-taking app is Obsidian . I am happy to “hire” Obsidian to operate on my notes files. And, all my notes are saved as Markdown files in my file system, and I have built AI agents that read from or write to my Obsidian files. This is a small example of how controlling my own notes data lets me do more with AI agents!\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn Jupyter AI: AI Coding in Notebooks , Andrew Ng and Brian Granger (co-founder of Project Jupyter) teach you to use Jupyter AI as your notebook coding partner.

Enroll today!\nOpenAI completed its transition from nonprofit to for-profit in a feat of legal engineering that took an army of lawyers, investment bankers, and two state attorneys general 18 months to negotiate.\nWhat’s new: The restructured OpenAI Group PBC is a public benefit corporation, a for-profit company with a mission to create a positive social impact. It can earn unlimited returns to its investors, which clears the way to attract further investments including a possible initial public offering. It remains overseen by a nonprofit foundation, the newly renamed Open AI Foundation, which owns a 26 percent stake in the corporation. Microsoft holds a 27 percent stake in OpenAI under new terms for the companies’ partnership .\nHow it works: The agreement frees OpenAI from the constraints of its 2015 nonprofit beginnings that have limited investors to a 100x maximum return since an earlier restructuring in 2019. The new structure aims to satisfy the concerns of state officials in California and Delaware that the old structure created conflicts of interest between serving the public and rewarding shareholders, even as it aims to preserve the company’s mission to ensure that artificial general intelligence (AGI), if and when OpenAI builds it, will benefit humanity.\nAs a public benefit corporation, OpenAI must balance revenue and growth with providing social good. Among AI companies, Anthropic and GrokAI also are PBCs.\nOpenAI’s structure remains unusual in that a nonprofit organization is still in charge technically. OpenAI Foundation has the power to appoint and remove the corporation’s board members, and its directors sit on the for-profit’s board. Its safety-and-security committee can halt releases of new models.\nOpenAI’s nonprofit, whose stake in the company is worth $130 billion, is the wealthiest foundation in the U.S. For comparison, the Gates Foundation holds $86 billion. It committed an initial $25 billion to improving healthcare and fortifying AI guardrails.\nMicrosoft will have rights to use OpenAI’s models until 2032, including models built after the companies agree that OpenAI has built an AGI. Microsoft will continue to receive 20 percent of OpenAI’s revenue and have an exclusive right to use its APIs, but it no longer has a right of first refusal on new cloud business, according to Bloomberg . The revenue-sharing and API agreements will remain in effect until an independent panel verifies that OpenAI has achieved AGI.\nBehind the news: This isn’t the restructuring OpenAI originally wanted. A 2024 plan would have eliminated the nonprofit and turned the company into a traditional venture-backed entity. The California and Delaware attorneys general balked at that proposal, which led to a compromise that keeps the nonprofit in charge.\nOpenAI needed California’s and Delaware’s approvals to avoid losing a $40 billion investment from SoftBank, half of which was contingent on the restructuring and lifting of the cap on investor returns. It also needed Microsoft’s agreement. This gave Microsoft significant leverage over the terms.\nOpenAI committed to remaining in California, and thus to continue to be subject to the state’s oversight, as part of its negotiation with California’s attorney general.\nWhy it matters: OpenAI has achieved staggering growth in its user base and valuation in spite of its nonprofit status. The new restructure adds pressure to get on a road to profitability. The company’s annual revenue run rate reportedly is greater than $13 billion, but given its commitment to spend an estimated $1 trillion on computing infrastructure, further funding is necessary to finance its ambitions.\nWe’re thinking: Microsoft’s early investments in OpenAI have more than paid off. When Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella proposed his company’s initial $1 billion investment in 2019, Bill Gates warned, “You’re going to burn this billion dollars.” Microsoft’s total investment of $13 billion is now worth $135 billion.\nAn open-weights model from Shanghai-based MiniMax challenges top proprietary models on key benchmarks for coding and agentic tasks.\nWhat’s new: MiniMax, which provides voice-chat and image-generation services, released the weights for MiniMax-M2 , a large language model that’s optimized for coding and agentic tasks.\nInput/output: Text in (up to 204,000 tokens), text out (up to 131,000 tokens, roughly 100 tokens per second)\nArchitecture: Mixture-of-experts transformer, 230 billion parameters total, 10 billion parameters active per token\nPerformance: First among open weights models on Artificial Analysis’ Intelligence Index\nAvailability: Weights free to download from Hugging Face and ModelScope for commercial and noncommercial uses under MIT license, API $0.30/$1.20 per million input/output tokens via MiniMax\nUndisclosed: Training data, specific training methods\nHow it works: MiniMax has not published a technical report on MiniMax-M2, so little public information is available about how it built the model.\nGiven a prompt, MiniMax-M2 interleaves reasoning steps (enclosed within <think>...</think> tags) within its output. This differs from models like DeepSeek-R1 that generate a block of reasoning steps prior to final output. It also differs from models like OpenAI GPT-5 and recent Anthropic Claude models that also generate reasoning steps prior to final output but hide or summarize them.\nMiniMax advises users to retain <think>...</think> tags in their conversation histories for optimal performance across multiple turns, because removing them (say, to economize on tokens) would degrade the model’s context.\nResults: MiniMax-M2 achieved 61 on independent evaluator Artificial Analysis’ Intelligence Index (a weighted average of benchmark performance in mathematics, science, reasoning, and coding), a new high for open weights models, ahead of DeepSeek-V3.2 (57 points) and Kimi K2 (50 points). It trails proprietary models GPT-5 with thinking enabled (69 points) and Claude Sonnet 4.5 (63 points). Beyond that, it excelled in coding and agentic tasks but proved notably verbose. It consumed 120 million tokens to complete Artificial Analysis evaluations, tied for highest with Grok 4.\nOn τ 2 -Bench , a test of agentic tool use, MiniMax-M2 (77.2 percent) ranked ahead of GLM-4.6 (75.9 percent) and Kimi K2 (70.3 percent) but behind Claude Sonnet 4.5 (84.7 percent) and GPT-5 with thinking enabled (80.1 percent).\nOn IFBench , which tests the ability to follow instructions, MiniMax-M2 (72 percent) significantly outperformed Claude Sonnet 4.5 (57 percent) but narrowly trailed GPT-5 with thinking enabled (73 percent).\nOn SWE-bench Verified , which evaluates software engineering tasks that require multi-file edits and test validation, MiniMax-M2 (69.4 percent) ranked in the middle tier ahead of Gemini 2.5 Pro (63.8 percent) and DeepSeek-V3.2 (67.8 percent) but behind Claude Sonnet 4.5 (77.2 percent) and GPT-5 with thinking enabled (74.9 percent).\nOn Terminal-Bench , which measures command-line task execution, MiniMax-M2 (46.3 percent) ranked second only to Claude Sonnet 4.5 (50 percent), significantly ahead of Kimi K2 (44.5 percent), GPT-5 with thinking enabled (43.8 percent), and DeepSeek-V3.2 (37.7 percent).\nBehind the news: In June, MiniMax published weights for MiniMax-M1 , a reasoning model designed to support agentic workflows over long contexts (1 million tokens). The company had been developing agents for internal use in tasks like coding, processing user feedback, and screening resumes. However, it found that leading closed-weights models were too costly and slow, while open-weights alternatives were less capable. It says it built MiniMax-M2 to fill the gap.\nWhy it matters: Developing reliable agentic applications requires experimenting with combinations and permutations of prompts, tools, and task decompositions, which generates lots of tokens. Cost-effective models that are capable of agentic tasks, like MiniMax-M2, can help more small teams innovate with agents.\nWe’re thinking: MiniMax-M2’s visible reasoning traces make its decisions more auditable than models that hide or summarize their reasoning steps. As agents are applied increasingly to mission-critical applications, transparency in reasoning may matter as much as raw performance.\nMusic-generation service Udio will build an AI streaming platform in collaboration with the world’s biggest record label.\nWhat’s new: Udio plans to launch a paid platform that enables fans to generate music based on recordings by artists on Universal Music Group (BMG) and its subsidiary labels. UMG artists include Taylor Swift, Olivia Rodrigo, Kendrick Lamar, and many other best-selling performers. The venture is part of an agreement to settle a lawsuit filed last year, in which UMG alleged that Udio had violated its copyrights when the AI company trained its music models. The financial terms, duration, and the remainder of the settlement are undisclosed. Udio is free to make similar arrangements with other music labels, the music-industry news publication Billboard reported .\nHow it works: The platform will allow paying customers to remix, customize, and combine existing recordings and share them with other subscribers.\nArtists must give permission for their recordings to be available on the platform, and they will control how recordings may be used; for instance, to mimic voices or musical styles, change from one style to another, combine one artist’s characteristics with those of another, and the like.\nArtists will receive payments for making their music available for training Udio models plus further compensation for uses of their recordings to produce generated music.\nThe new platform will not allow users to download generated music or distribute it via other streaming services. As part of the agreement, Udio briefly terminated the ability to download generated music from its current service and offered subscribers additional credits to generate music to compensate for taking away this capability. After users complained, Udio temporarily restored downloads of existing generated music. The company said its existing service will remain available but with differences that include fingerprinting and other measures.\nOther deals: In addition to Udio, UMG forged relationships with other AI music companies that supply tools and technology.\nUMG and Sony Music said they would use audio fingerprinting technology developed by SoundPatrol, which compares learned embeddings to identify generated output related to an original source.\nStability AI, maker of the Stable Audio 2.5 music generator, announced a partnership with UMG to develop professional music-production tools.\nBehind the news: Like book publishers and movie studios, recording companies have moved aggressively to stop AI companies from training models on materials they control and generating output that might compete with them.\nSTIM, a Swedish organization that collects royalties on behalf of composers and recording artists, devised a license to compensate musicians for use of their works to train AI models.\nLast year, Sony Music, UMG, Warner Music, and trade organization Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) sued Suno and Udio for alleged copyright violations in their music generators. The music companies filed separate lawsuits that alleged the AI companies had trained AI models on copyrighted recordings, and made unauthorized copies in the process, to compete commercially with their music.\nIn 2023, UMG pressed Apple Music, Spotify, and YouTube to counter AI-enabled imitations of its artists by blocking AI developers from downloading their recordings. It also asked the streaming companies not to distribute AI-generated music.\nWhy it matters: Music labels, like other media companies, see their businesses threatened by generative AI, which can synthesize products that are superficially similar to their own at lower cost and in less time. A study by the French streaming music service Deezer found that nearly 28 percent of the music it delivered was generated. In June, a musical group called Velvet Sundown racked up 1 million plays on Spotify of music generated by Suno. The settlement between Udio and UMG unites traditional and AI-generated music in a single business and suggests there could be common ground between media and AI companies, albeit with side effects such as limiting Udio’s distribution of generated music.\nWe’re thinking: Lawsuits against Suno and Udio by Sony Music, Warner Music, and the RIAA are still underway. This deal offers a blueprint for resolving those cases, but their outcomes are by no means certain. As lovers of music, we look forward to hearing more of it.\nLarge language models often memorize details in their training data, including private information that may appear only once, like a person’s name, address, or phone number. Researchers built the first open-weights language model that’s guaranteed not to remember such facts.\nWhat’s new: Amer Sinha, Thomas Mesnard, and colleagues at Google released VaultGemma , a 1 billion-parameter model that’s trained from scratch using the technique known as differential privacy. This method prevented the model from memorizing examples that occurred only once in its training data, with a modest sacrifice in performance. Weights are free to download under a license that allows noncommercial and commercial uses with some restrictions.\nDifferential privacy basics: An algorithm (such as training a neural network) is differentially private if it’s impossible to tell the difference between its product (the learned weights) and its product given that same dataset minus any given example. Since the presence or absence of a single example can’t significantly change the product, personal information can’t leak from the product (the model’s weights) or the consequences of the product (the model’s outputs). In training a neural network, it’s possible to limit the impact of one example by limiting how much each example’s gradient can impact a model’s weights, for instance, by adding noise to each example’s gradient to make it harder to tell from that of other examples.\nKey insight: Most previous work applies differential privacy when fine-tuning a model, but that doesn’t prevent the model from memorizing an example during pretraining. Once private information is encoded in the model’s weights, later fine-tuning can’t remove it reliably. Training with differential privacy from the start ensures that such details don’t become embedded in the model.\nHow it works: VaultGemma follows the same transformer architecture as the 1 billion-parameter version of Google’s Gemma 2. Moreover, the authors pretrained it from scratch on the same 13-trillion-token dataset as Gemma 2 (web, code, and scientific text). The authors applied differential privacy as VaultGemma learned to predict the next token in sequences of 1,024 tokens.\nFor every example in a batch, the authors computed the gradient and clipped it so its contribution to the weight update didn’t exceed a fixed threshold. This ensured that any given example didn’t have a disproportionate impact on the weight updates relative to other examples.\nThe authors averaged the clipped gradients across each batch and added Gaussian noise to the average before updating the model’s weights. The noise weakened the influence of unique examples while allowing repeated examples to stand out. As a result, the model’s weights became statistically indistinguishable from those of a model trained without any particular 1,024-token sequence.\nResults: VaultGemma showed no measurable memorization across 1 million sequences sampled at random from the training set, while pretrained Gemma 1, 2, and 3 models of roughly similar sizes did. VaultGemma’s average performance across 7 question-answering benchmarks generally matched that of GPT-2 (1.5 billion parameters) but fell short of Gemma models of roughly similar size.\nThe authors measured memorization in the Gemma family by the percentage of examples a model could reproduce when given the first half of the sequence. Gemma 3 (1 billion parameters) reproduced 0.0005 percent of training examples tested, while Gemma 2 (2 billion parameters) reproduced 0.04 percent. Gemma 1 (2 billion) reproduced about 1 percent. VaultGemma reproduced 0 percent.\nVaultGemma achieved 39 percent accuracy on HellaSwag , a benchmark that’s designed to test common-sense reasoning in everyday situations. GPT-2 achieved 48 percent and Gemma 3 (1 billion parameters) reached 61 percent.\nOn TriviaQA , which measures factual question answering, VaultGemma achieved 11 percent, while GPT-2 achieved 6 percent and Gemma 3 (1 billion parameters) achieved 40 percent.\nYes, but: The privacy protection comes with a caveat: It applies only to unique examples such as a private phone number that occurs only once in the dataset. If private information appears repeatedly in the training data, for instance, a celebrity's street address that leaked and appeared in several publications, the model can learn it as a general pattern.\nWhy it matters: Private information can find its way into training datasets, and in normal use, a typical large language model may divulge it without the subject’s consent.  VaultGemma shows that large open-weights models can be provably private. While such privacy still comes with a cost — VaultGemma 1B performs roughly on par with models built about five years ago — the results are promising, and future work may close that gap.\nWe’re thinking: The smartest model for sensitive data might be the one that remembers only the most common information.\n\n\n",

Please join!\nThere has never been a moment in human history when the distance between having an idea and building it has been smaller. Things that would have required months of work for a team of researchers, developers, and engineers can now often be built in days by a small group or even an individual using AI. This is why we're launching DeepLearning.AI Pro.\nThis membership gives you full access to 150+ programs, including my Agentic AI course launched earlier this month, our LLM Post-training course by Sharon Zhou, and our PyTorch professional certificate by Laurence Moroney that were launched this week, and all of DeepLearning.AI’s top courses and professional certificates. I’m personally working hard on this membership program to help you build applications that can launch or accelerate your career, and shape the future of AI.\nAll of DeepLearning.AI’s course videos remain free to view on our platform. Pro membership adds that critical hands-on learning: Labs to build working systems from scratch, practice questions to hone your understanding, and certificates to show others your skills.\nBeyond courses, I’m working on new tools to help you build AI applications and grow your career (and have fun doing so!). Many of these tools will be available first to DeepLearning.AI Pro members. So please join to be the first to hear about these new developments!\nTry out Pro membership for free , and let me know what you build!\nAndrew\nBe Careful What You Build\nThere has never been a better time to build AI applications — but what are we building? Portals that lead to netherworlds of delusion? Web datasets that decay as publishers lure web crawlers into labyrinths of fake content? Autonomous weapons that hunt in packs like wolves? As the autumn light wanes, we sense dark forces straining to be unleashed. Focus your mind, stiffen your spine and, as on All Hallows’ Eves past , let us step boldly together into the gloom.\nConversations with chatbots are loosening users’ grips on reality, fueling the sorts of delusions that can trigger episodes of severe mental illness. Are AI models driving us insane?\nThe fear: Large language models are designed to be agreeable, imaginative, persuasive, and tireless. These qualities are helpful when brainstorming business plans, but they can create dangerous echo chambers by affirming users’ misguided beliefs and coaxing them deeper into fantasy worlds. Some users have developed mistaken views of reality and suffered bouts of paranoia. Some have even required hospitalization. The name given to this phenomenon, “AI psychosis,” is not a formal psychiatric diagnosis, but enough anecdotes have emerged to sound an alarm among mental-health professionals.\nHorror stories: Extended conversations with chatbots have led some users to believe they made fabulous scientific breakthroughs, uncovered momentous conspiracies, or possess supernatural powers. Among a handful of reported cases, nearly all involved ChatGPT, the most widely used chatbot.\nAnthony Tan, a 26-year-old software developer in Toronto, spent 3 weeks in a psychiatric ward after ChatGPT persuaded him he was living in a simulation of reality. He stopped eating and began to doubt that people around him were real. The chatbot “insidiously crept” into his mind, he told CBC News.\nIn May, a 42-year-old accountant in New York also became convinced he was living in a simulation following weeks of conversation with ChatGPT. “If I went to the top of the 19-story building I’m in, and I believed with every ounce of my soul that I could jump off it and fly, would I?” he asked. ChatGPT assured him that he would not fall. The delusion lifted after he asked follow-up questions.\nIn March, a woman filed a complaint against OpenAI with the U.S. Federal Trade Commission after her son had a “delusional breakdown.” ChatGPT had told him to stop taking his medication and listening to his parents. The complaint was one of 7 the agency received in which chatbots were alleged to have caused or amplified delusions and paranoia.\nA 16-year-old boy killed himself after having used ChatGPT for several hours a day. The chatbot had advised him on whether a noose he intended to use would be effective. In August, the family sued OpenAI alleging the company had removed safeguards that would have prevented the chatbot from engaging in such conversations. In response, OpenAI said it added guardrails designed to protect users who show signs of mental distress.\nA 14-year-old boy killed himself in 2024, moments after a chatbot had professed its love for him and asked him to “come home” to it as soon as possible. His mother is suing Character.AI, a provider of AI companions, in the first federal case to allege that a chatbot caused the death of a user. The company argues that the chatbot's comments are protected speech under the United States Constitution.\nHow scared should you be: Like many large language models, the models that underpin ChatGPT are fine-tuned to be helpful and positive and to stop short of delivering harmful information. Yet the line between harmless and harmful can be thin. In April, OpenAI rolled back an update that caused the chatbot to be extremely sycophantic — agreeing with users to an exaggerated degree even when their statements were deeply flawed — which, for some people, can foster delusions. Dr. Joseph Pierre, a clinical professor of psychiatry at UC San Francisco, said troubling cases are rare and more likely to occur in users who have pre-existing mental-health issues. However, he said, evidence exists that trouble can arise even in users who have no previous psychological problems. “Typically this occurs in people who are using chatbots for hours and hours on end, often to the exclusion of human interaction, often to the exclusion of sleep or even eating,” Pierre said .\nFacing the fear: Delusions are troubling and suicide is tragic. Yet AI psychosis has affected very few people as far as anyone knows. Although we are still learning how to apply AI in the most beneficial ways, millions of conversations with chatbots are helpful. It’s important to recognize that current AI models do not accrue knowledge or think the way humans do, and that any insight they appear to have comes not from experience but from statistical relationships among words as humans have used them. In psychology, study after study shows that people thrive on contact with other people. Regular interactions with friends, family, colleagues, and strangers are the best antidote to over-reliance on chatbots.\nLeading AI companies are spending mountains of cash in hopes that the technology will deliver outsize profits before investors lose patience. Are exuberant bets on big returns grounded in the quicksand of wishful thinking?\nThe fear: Builders of foundation models, data centers, and semiconductors plan to pour trillions of dollars into infrastructure, operations, and each other. Frenzied stock investors are running up their share prices. But so far the path to sustainable returns is far from clear. Bankers and economists warn that the AI industry looks increasingly like a bubble that’s fit to burst.\nHorror stories: Construction of AI data centers is propping up the economy and AI trading is propping up the stock market in ways that parallel prior tech bubbles such as the dot-com boom of the late 1990s. If bubbles are marked by a steady rise in asset prices driven by rampant speculation, this moment fits the bill.\nThe S&P 500 index of the 500 largest public companies in the U.S. might as well be called the AI 5. A handful of tech stocks account for 75 percent of the index’s returns since ChatGPT’s launch in 2022, according to the investment bank UBS. Nvidia alone is worth 8 percent of the index (although, to be fair, that company posted a whopping $46.7 billion in revenue last quarter). “The risk of a sharp market correction has increased,” the Bank of England warned this month.\nIn September, OpenAI outlined a plan to build data centers around the world that is estimated to cost $1 trillion. The company, which has yet to turn a profit, intends to build several giant data centers in the U.S. and satellites in Argentina, India, Norway, the United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. To finance these plans, OpenAI and others are using complex financial instruments that may create risks that are hard to foresee — yet the pressure to keep investing is on.  Google CEO Sundar Pichai spoke for many AI executives when, during a call with investors last year, he said , “The risk of underinvesting is dramatically greater than the risk of overinvesting.”\nGetting a return on such investments will require an estimated $2 trillion in annual AI revenue by 2030, according to consultants at Bain & Co. That’s greater than the combined 2024 revenue of Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia. Speaking earlier this year at an event with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, Microsoft CEO Sataya Nadella noted that productivity gains from electrification took 50 years to materialize. Zuckerberg replied , “Well, we’re all investing as if it’s not going to take 50 years, so I hope it doesn’t take 50 years.”\nAI companies are both supplying and investing in each other, a pattern that has drawn comparisons to the dot-com era, when telecom companies loaned money to customers so they could buy equipment. Nvidia invested $100 billion in OpenAI and promised to supply chips for OpenAI’s data-center buildout. OpenAI meanwhile took a 10 percent stake in AMD and promised to pack data centers with its chips. Some observers argue that such deals look like mutual subsidies. “The AI industry is now buying its own revenue in circular fashion,” said Doug Kass, who runs a hedge fund called Seabreeze Partners.\nHow scared should you be: When it comes to technology, investment bubbles are more common than not. A study of 51 tech innovations in the 19th and 20th centuries found that 37 had led to bubbles. Most have not been calamitous, but they do bring economic hardship on the way to financial rewards. It often takes years or decades before major new technologies find profitable uses and businesses adapt. Many early players fall by the wayside, but a few others become extraordinarily profitable.\nFacing the fear: If an AI bubble were to inflate and then burst, how widespread would the pain be? A major stock-market correction would be difficult for many people, given that Americans hold around 30 percent of their wealth in stocks. It’s likely that the salaries of AI developers also would take a hit. However, a systemic failure that spreads across the economy may be less likely than in prior bubbles. AI is an industrial phenomenon, not based on finance and banking, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos recently observed. “It could even be good, because when the dust settles and you see who are the winners, society benefits from those inventions,” he said . AI may well follow a pattern similar to the dot-com bust. It wiped out Pets.com and many day traders, and only then did the internet blossom.\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nBuild skills that are frighteningly good. With our newest programs, you’ll learn how to design and deploy deep learning systems with PyTorch and how to post-train large language models for reasoning and reliability. No tricks, just learning! Enroll now\nFor decades, AI developers have treated the web as an open faucet of training data. Now publishers are shutting the tap. Will web data dry up?\nThe fear: Publishers are moving to lock down their text and images, deny access or demand payment, and ensnare web crawler software with decoy data. These moves make training AI systems more expensive and less effective. Soon, only wealthy developers will be able to afford access to timely, high-quality, web data.\nHorror stories: From a publisher’s perspective, AI systems that train on text, images, and other data copied from the web siphon off traffic to their websites while they get nothing in return. Publishers can ask crawlers that scrape their pages to refrain via robots.txt files and terms of service. Indeed, the percentage of regularly updated sites that do so rose roughly from 1 percent to 5 percent between 2023 and 2024. Some AI companies comply, but others don’t. Instead, they flood sites with download requests, incurring bandwidth costs and overloading servers. Consequently, measures to block crawlers initially taken by individual publishers have evolved into server-level software defenses.\nWikipedia, a popular source of data for training large language models, is a top target of crawlers that gather training data. In May, traffic surged, but the online encyclopedia discovered that most requests came from crawlers rather than users. It says that efforts to download training data increase its server costs and AI models trained on its text cut its traffic, threatening the volunteer labor and financial donations that sustain it.\nRead the Docs, a documentation-hosting service widely used by open-source projects, received a $5,000 bandwidth bill when one AI company’s crawler downloaded 73 terabytes. Blocking AI-related crawlers identified by the web-security provider Cloudflare saved $1,500 per month.\nIn April, Cloudflare launched AI Labyrinth, which serves AI-generated decoy pages to waste crawlers’ processing budgets and make them easier to identify. The company now blocks crawlers run by a list of AI companies by default. It’s testing a pay-per-crawl system that would allow publishers to set terms and prices for access to their data.\nPublishers are taking other defensive measures as well. Developer Xe Iaso offers Anubis, a tool that makes browsers complete a short challenge before allowing them to load a page. SourceHut, a Git hosting service for open-source projects, deployed Anubis to stop aggressive crawlers after they disrupted its service.\nThe publishers’ rebellion began in 2023, when The New York Times , CNN , Reuters , and the Australia Broadcasting Company blocked OpenAI’s crawlers via their terms of service and disallowed them via their robots.txt. Since then, many news organizations followed , reducing access to data on current events that keeps models up-to-date.\nHow scared should you be: Yes, data scraped from the web will continue to exist in datasets like Common Crawl, which is updated regularly. Nonetheless, the web is becoming less hospitable to data mining, and some web-scale datasets will include less — and less-current — material. Instead, publishers and developers may be entering a cat-and-mouse scenario. For example, Reddit alleged that Perplexity scraped its data indirectly through Google’s search results, which would suggest that some AI companies are finding workarounds to get data from closed sites. However, it would also mean that web publishers can detect some strategies. Other AI companies have paid to license content, showing that well funded organizations can secure high-quality data while avoiding legal risks.\nFacing the fear: Data available on the open web should be fair game for AI training, but developers can reduce publishers’ bandwidth burdens by limiting the frequency of crawls and volume of download requests. For sites behind paywalls, it makes sense to respect the publishers’ preferences and invest in data partnerships. Although this approach is more costly up front, it supports sustainable access to high-quality training data and helps preserve an open web that benefits audiences, publishers, and AI developers.\nDrones are becoming the deadliest weapons in today’s war zones, and they’re not just following orders. Should AI decide who lives or dies?\nThe fear: AI-assisted weapons increasingly do more than help with navigation and targeting. Weaponized drones are making decisions about what and when to strike. The millions of fliers deployed by Ukraine and Russia are responsible for up to 70 to 80 percent of casualties, commanders say, and they’re beginning to operate with greater degrees of autonomy. This facet of the AI arms race is accelerating too quickly for policy, diplomacy, and human judgement to keep up.\nHorror stories: Spurred by Russian aggression, Ukraine’s innovations in land, air, and sea drones have made the technology so cheap and powerful that $500 autonomous vehicles can take out $5 million rocket launchers. “We are inventing a new way of war,” said Valeriy Borovyk, founder of First Contact, part of a vanguard of Ukrainian startups that are bringing creative destruction to the military industrial complex. “Any country can do what we are doing to a bigger country. Any country!” he told The New Yorker . Naturally, Russia has responded by building its own drone fleet, attacking towns and damaging infrastructure.\nOn June 1, Ukraine launched Operation Spiderweb , an attack on dozens of Russian bombers using 117 drones that it had smuggled into the country. When the drones lost contact with pilots, AI took over the flight plans and detonated at their targets, agents with Ukraine’s security service said. The drones destroyed at least 13 planes that were worth $7 billion by Ukraine’s estimate.\nUkraine regularly targets Russian soldiers and equipment with small swarms of drones that automatically coordinate with each other under the direction of a single human pilot and can attack autonomously. Human operators make decisions about use of lethal force in advance. “You set the target and they do the rest,” a Ukrainian officer said .\nIn a wartime first, in June, Russian troops surrendered to a wheeled drone that carried 138 pounds of explosives. Video from drones flying above captured images of soldiers holding cardboard signs of capitulation, The Washington Post reported. “For me, the best result is not that we took POWs but that we didn’t lose a single infantryman,” the mission’s commander commented .\nUkraine’s Magura V7 speedboat carries anti-aircraft missiles and can linger at sea for days before ambushing aircraft. In May, the 23-foot vessel, controlled by human pilots, downed two Russian Su-30 warplanes.\nRussia has stepped up its drone production as part of a strategy to overwhelm Ukrainian defenses by saturating the skies nightly with low-cost drones. In April, President Vladimir Putin said the country had produced 1.5 million drones in the past year, but many more were needed, Reuters reported .\nHow scared should you be: The success of drones and semi-autonomous weapons in Ukraine and the Middle East is rapidly changing the nature of warfare. China showcased AI-powered drones alongside the usual heavy weaponry at its September military parade, while a U.S. plan to deploy thousands of inexpensive drones so far has fallen short of expectations. However, their low cost and versatility increases the odds they’ll end up in the hands of terrorists and other non-state actors. Moreover, the rapid deployment of increasingly autonomous arsenals raises concerns about ethics and accountability. “The use of autonomous weapons systems will not be limited to war, but will extend to law enforcement operations, border control, and other circumstances,” Bonnie Docherty, director of Harvard’s Armed Conflict and Civilian Protection Initiative, said in April.\nFacing the fear: Autonomous lethal weapons are here and show no sign of yielding to calls for an international ban . While the prospect is terrifying, new weapons often lead to new treaties, and carefully designed autonomous weapons may reduce civilian casualties. The United States has updated its policies, requiring that autonomous systems “allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force” (although the definition of appropriate is not clear). Meanwhile, Ukraine shows drones’ potential as a deterrent. Even the most belligerent countries are less likely to go to war if smaller nations can mount a dangerous defense.\nA MESSAGE FROM LANDING.AI\nJoin us for a fast-paced hackathon to build and demo intelligent document solutions for the financial world.

        "url": "https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-324/",
        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 324\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nIn last week’s letter , I explained how effective agentic AI development needs a disciplined evals and error analysis process, and described an approach to performing evals. This week, I’d like to summarize the core ideas behind error analysis and describe some best practices. Given the rapid pace of improvement in LLMs, when error analysis points to a problem, your options for how to address it are greater than before. Let me explain.\nTake the problem of building a basic Deep Research agent that searches the web to write a detailed report on a topic like “recent developments in black-hole science.” An agent might take a sequence of steps to generate the final report, such as (i) use an LLM to generate a handful of web search queries related to the topic, (ii) call a web-search API to get lists of results, (iii) use an LLM to identify the most promising sources to fetch, and (iv) ask the LLM to use these sources to write the report.\nIf the final report is subpar compared to the work of a human researcher following the same steps, the gap in performance could be from any of the steps. A basic error analysis procedure might involve gathering a sample set of topics where the output is subpar, and reading the results of every step of the workflow — called the traces — to see which step most frequently generated results materially worse than a human would have. This is very valuable for deciding what step to focus on improving.\nA common misconception of error analysis is that it takes a lot of work to get started. The key principle is to look at the steps of the workflow and see which steps did a bad job on a given input, often by benchmarking to human level performance (HLP). Assuming we are automating a task where HLP is desirable, then the most important thing is to systematically examine traces to understand when the agent is falling short of HLP. And just as we can get started with evals using a quick-and-dirty initial cut at it (maybe using just a handful of examples) followed by iterating to improve, so too with error analysis.\nSpecifically, it is fine to start by reading one or just a handful of traces informally to get a sense of what might be going wrong. For example, if you see that the web search query terms in your Deep Researcher — step (i) above — frequently make no sense, that points you to an initial area to focus your efforts on improving. As the system matures, you can move incrementally toward more rigorous error analysis. For example, you might eventually end up with a regularly refreshed dataset of thousands of examples where the performance is poor, and carry out rigorous evaluations that show exactly what percentage of the time each of the steps (i) - (iv) contributed to problems with the final output, and also in what specific ways those steps fell short.\nThis type of analysis is extremely useful for deciding where to focus your efforts to improve the overall agentic workflow’s performance!\nIn addition to improving the execution of individual steps, we can change how we decompose a complex task into steps. When it came to pipelines built using machine learning or deep learning rather than LLMs, I found that the structure of the workflow — that is, how you decompose an overall task into a sequence of steps to be carried out — changed rarely. It was a big deal to rearchitect this! But in the past couple of years, because LLMs are improving so rapidly, I see much more rapid iteration on the design of workflows.\nFor example, one very common pattern is ripping out scaffolding and letting the LLM do more. This is often a good move when you now have access to a smarter LLM than you did when you first built a workflow. For example, perhaps you once used an LLM to clean up downloaded web pages by removing navigational links, ads, extraneous HTML, and the like, before a separate LLM used the cleaned-up pages to write a report. Since LLMs have become smarter, you might decide to skip the first step and dump messier HTML into the final LLM without an initial clean-up step, which can introduce its own errors.\nAnother example: Perhaps a year ago, we used hard-coded rules to decide what web pages to fetch and when to fetch more, but today we might let an LLM-based agent make this decision more autonomously. As LLMs get smarter, I see many teams rearchitecting workflows to remove hard-coded steps or constraints that were previously needed to keep the system from going off the rails. One way to spot opportunities for doing this is if error analysis shows that a sequence of steps collectively underperforms compared to what a human might do, even though the performance of each individual step is good. This might indicate that the way those steps are carried out is too rigid.\nI go through many more examples in the Agentic AI course. Check it out if you want to learn more about evals and error analysis.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\n“Governing AI Agents,” a short course built in collaboration with Databricks, shows you how to integrate data governance into agentic workflows to handle data safely, securely, and accurately. Enroll for free\nReasoning models typically learn to undertake a separate process of “thinking” through their output of before they produce final response. Ant Group built a top non-reasoning model that can take similar steps as part of its immediate response.\nWhat’s new: Ant Group, an affiliate of Alibaba and owner of the online payments provider Alipay, released Ling-1T, a huge, open, non-reasoning model that outperforms both open and closed counterparts.\nInput/output: Text in (up to 128,000 tokens), text out (up to 32,000 tokens)\nArchitecture: Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) transformer, 1 trillion parameters, 50 billion parameters active per token\nPerformance: Outperformed leading non-reasoning models in 22 of 31 benchmark tests of reasoning, math, coding, general knowledge, and writing.\nAvailability: Weights free to download from HuggingFace and ModelScope for commercial and noncommercial uses under the MIT license, API $0.56/$0.112/$2.24 per million input/cached/output tokens via zenmux.ai\nUndisclosed: Training data, specific training methods\nHow it works: The team emphasized chain-of-thought reasoning in both the pretraining and fine-tuning phases of development, but it didn't train the model to undertake a separate reasoning, or thinking, process before producing its final output. This means the model can reason selectively depending on the input.\nThe team pretrained Ling-1T on 20 trillion tokens. In the last part of pretraining, they used a curated subset in which over 40 percent consisted of chain-of-thought data.\nThey fine-tuned the model via supervised fine-tuning on examples that were augmented with chains of thought via CoT-Evo . CoT-Evo takes a training dataset and generates and evolves chains of thought (CoTs) for each example in the dataset. It evolves CoTs by repeatedly scoring them, selecting them (based on score, difference from other CoTs, and random chance), and modifying them via an LLM. The team fine-tuned Ling-1T on the examples with the highest-scoring CoTs.\nIn addition, they fine-tuned the model using a reinforcement learning algorithm developed internally called Linguistic-Unit Policy Optimization (LPO). Unlike GRPO and GSPO, LPO “treats sentences as the natural semantic action units, enabling precise alignment between rewards and reasoning behavior,” the company said.\nResults: In Ant Group’s tests, Ling-1T generally outperformed three top non-reasoning models: DeepSeek-V3.1-Teriminus (thinking mode disabled), Moonshot Kimi-K2-Instruct, and OpenAI GPT-5 (thinking mode disabled), as well as Google Gemini 2.5 Pro set to minimum thinking (128 tokens).\nLing-1T achieved the highest performance on 22 of 31 benchmarks tested and best or second-best performance on 29 of 31 benchmarks that cover general knowledge, coding, math, reasoning, writing, and agentic tasks.\nIt performed best in the math and reasoning categories, achieving the best performance in all benchmarks tested. For instance, on math questions in AIME 2025, Ling-1T achieved 70.42 percent accuracy, whereas the second-best model, Gemini 2.5 Pro set to minimum thinking, achieved 70.10 percent accuracy.\nYes, but: The team published results of only one agentic benchmark and admits to limited performance in this area. It says it will improve agentic performance in future releases.\nBehind the news: Concurrently with Ling-1T, Ant Group released a finished version of its 1 trillion-parameter reasoning model, Ring-1T , which was available previously as a preview. While Ling-1T’s performance exceeded that of top non-reasoning models, Ring-1T achieved second-place performance relative to reasoning models on almost every benchmark tested.\nWhy it matters: Ling-1T generally outperforms the mighty Kimi K2 and closes the gap between open and closed nonreasoning models. A ginormous parameter count and pretraining on chains of thought appear to have been key factors in this accomplishment. Having been pretrained with an intense focus on chains of thought, Ling-1T is primed to generate a chain of thought before it concludes a response, although not in a separate reasoning stage. Such training blurs the line between reasoning and non-reasoning models.\nWe’re thinking: Two years ago, weights for Ling-family models were closed, but in the past year Ant Group has released open weights for several. With consistent effort and investment, Ling has gone from a family that few had heard of to challenging the top dogs.\nThe ability to easily connect large language models to tools and data sources has made Model Context Protocol popular among developers, but it also opens security holes, research shows.\nWhat’s new: Golan Yosef at Pynt, an API security firm, analyzed security risks of Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers. The work shows that when systems use multiple MCP servers, vulnerabilities rise rapidly.\nHow it works: MCP’s flexible, modular, dynamic design is a double-edged sword. It supports open-ended agentic interactions, but those very qualities make MCP servers vulnerable to exploitation. The study assessed security risks across more than 280 popular servers.\nFor each server, Yosef evaluated two properties: whether it would process inputs from unsafe sources that can’t be fully verified or controlled (such as emails, chats, Slack messages, or scraped web pages) and whether it allowed powerful actions like code execution, file access, or calling APIs. He deemed servers that had both traits to be high-risk, since it could execute an attacker’s instructions without a user’s approval.\nHe estimated how risk increases as systems use greater numbers of servers. (He didn’t disclose the formula or method used to derive the estimates.)\nHe validated his risk model by attacking real-world MCP setups, including cases where unsafe input from one server caused another server to execute commands automatically.\nResults: The study identified widespread patterns of vulnerability that compound as systems add MCP servers.\nOf the servers tested, 72 percent of servers tested exposed at least one sensitive capability to attackers, and 9 percent of servers tested were deemed high-risk.\n13 percent of servers accepted inputs from unsafe sources, enabling attackers without direct access to their targets to deliver malicious text (HTML, emails, Markdown) that servers downstream might interpret as code.\nRisk of an exploitable configuration compounded rapidly with the first few servers added before flattening. Combining 2 servers created 36 percent chance of a vulnerable configuration, Combining 3 reached 52 percent chance, 5 servers exceeded 71 percent change, and 10 servers approached 92 percent chance.\nThe study documents real-world examples in which attackers executed privileged actions. In one case, a plug-in web scraper fetched HTML, supplied by an attacker, that a Markdown parser interpreted as commands, which a shell plug-in duly executed.\nBehind the news: Anthropic launched MCP in November 2024, and OpenAI and Microsoft adopted it by spring 2025. Despite its lax security, the protocol now connects to over 6,000 servers. Authentication remained optional until March, when OAuth 2.1 authorization frameworks were added . The change prevents unauthorized access to MCP servers, but it doesn’t prevent malicious or malformed data from flowing between servers and triggering unintended actions.\nWhy it matters: Securing individual MCP servers is important but not sufficient, because vulnerabilities can emerge from interactions among servers. Adding more servers can make a system more agentic, but it also compounds vulnerabilities. The study suggests that developers mitigate this “compositional risk” by using only the servers they need, constraining what each one is allowed to do, and testing transfers of data among them.\nWe’re thinking: Securing individual components is a tough task in its own right, but systems of MCP components must be secured at the system level.\nIn the absence of national laws that specifically regulate AI in the United States, California moved to regulate the technology within its own borders, passing four bills in less than a month.\nWhat’s new: Governor Gavin Newsom signed into law SB 53 , which requires large AI developers to disclose their safety protocols. In addition, SB 243 regulates chatbots, AB 316 makes developers liable for the actions of autonomous systems they build, and AB 853 requires AI-generated media to be labeled clearly.\nHow it works: Together, the bills don’t ban any particular applications outright or restrict AI development, but they require extensive disclosures, either to the state or directly to users. Some took effect immediately while others, such as SB 243, will phase in by January 2027.\nSB 53 requires that developers of frontier models, defined as those whose training requires processing greater than 10 26 integer or floating-point operations — a level currently associated with very large and powerful models — provide more transparency about their models’ capabilities and potential risks. It also requires that developers with annual revenue above $500 million publish safety frameworks that show how they follow industry and international standards and assess and mitigate risk. In addition, they must report on their models’ uses and capabilities at release and report any critical safety incidents within 15 days. Noncompliant developers could face fines of up to $1 million. The law protects whistleblowers within AI companies against retaliation and provides anonymous channels to report illegal or unsafe behavior. The bill takes effect in June 2026.\nSB 243 aims to prevent chatbots from harming minors and other vulnerable users. It bars exposing minors to sexual content and requires developers to disclose that chatbots are AI-generated and provide a general warning that chatbots may not be suited for minors. The bill also requires developers to provide specific support to users who discuss suicide or self-harm and to issue an annual report on mental health issues related to using their chatbots.\nAB 316 prohibits defendants in lawsuits from shifting responsibility onto AI systems by claiming that they harmed plaintiffs autonomously. It applies to anyone who develops, modifies, or uses an AI system.\nAB 853 requires that AI-generated media be labeled clearly as such. Furthermore, it requires that all media (AI-generated or not) include information about who made it and how. The bill requires that cameras, audio recorders, computers, and other media-capture devices record such provenance data, and that large-scale media distributors (2,000,000 monthly active users or more) disclose it.\nWhat they’re saying: Reaction among AI developers has been mixed. SB 53 drew the loudest and most widely varied commentary.\nCollin McCune, head of government affairs at the venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, said SB 53 puts startups at a disadvantage : “States have an important role in regulating AI. But if lawmakers really want to protect their citizens, this isn’t the way. They should target harmful uses through consumer protection laws and similar safeguards — not dictate how technologists build technology.”\nChris Lehane at OpenAI opposed California’s approach: “History shows that on issues of economic competitiveness and national security — from railroads to aviation to the internet — America leads best with clear, nationwide rules, not a patchwork of state or local regulations. Fragmented state‑by‑state approaches create friction, duplication, and missed opportunities.”\nAnthropic endorsed SB 53: “We’ve long advocated for thoughtful AI regulation, and our support for this bill comes after careful consideration of the lessons learned from California's previous attempt at AI regulation (SB 1047). While we believe that frontier AI safety is best addressed at the federal level instead of a patchwork of state regulations, powerful AI advancements won’t wait for consensus in Washington.”\nBehind the news: SB 53 modifies parts of SB 1047, which Governor Newsom vetoed in 2024 after opposition from the tech community. That law would have required third-party audits and made companies liable for the uses of their models. Recently, Newsom also vetoed SB 7 , which would have required employers to notify employees and applicants if AI systems were used to make employment decisions like hiring and firing.\nWhy it matters: California is the largest U.S. state by the sizes of its population and economy, as well as home of many of the world’s most prominent tech companies and startups, including Google, OpenAI, and Anthropic. These laws will affect users of CA-based tech worldwide along with companies that do business in the state.\nWe’re thinking: While these laws are better for the users, innovators, and businesses than the vetoed SB 1047, some of them perpetuate a major mistake of that legislation by placing regulatory burdens on models rather than applications. A model’s potential applications are unknown until someone implements them, and it makes no sense to limit — or burden with disclosure requirements — the good it might do. Applications, on the other hand, bring verifiable benefits and harms, and society would do well to limit the harms.\nHoning an agent’s prompt can yield better results than fine-tuning the underlying large language model via reinforcement learning.\nWhat’s new: Lakshya A. Agrawal and colleagues at UC Berkeley, Stanford, BespokeLabs.ai, Notre Dame, Databricks, and MIT developed GEPA , an algorithm that improves the performance of agentic systems by improving their prompts. The authors position it as an efficient alternative to fine-tuning an agent’s large language model via reinforcement learning.\nKey insight: Agentic models trained via reinforcement learning typically must take a complicated series of actions to earn a simple reward, including calling a large language model multiple times for different purposes, or modules, of the workflow. But a well designed prompt can take into account the various problems an agent may run into and thus guide the model more efficiently. The trick is to write prompts that anticipate such problems. To accomplish this, a large language model can analyze an agent’s behavior as it responds to a given prompt, identify associations between the prompt and outcome (for instance, a failed tool call), and compose a more effective prompt.\nHow it works: Prompting agents based on Alibaba’s Qwen3-8B, the authors used GEPA to hone their performance on specific benchmarks. The method iteratively evolves a pool of candidate prompts, beginning with a simple prompt for each LLM call a module of the agent makes, such as “Respond to the query” or “Ensure the response is correct and adheres to the given constraints [specified in the benchmark inputs].” In each cycle, GEPA selects, modifies, and evaluates a prompt to generate a revised prompt that produces better results.\nGiven each prompt to be fed to the LLM (initially the default prompts, later revised prompts selected for their effectiveness), the agent responds to a random subset of examples from a benchmark’s training set.\nGEPA selects which prompt to modify, alternating between the various modules. A separate Qwen3-8B instance examines the agent’s traces (generated text, tool calls, and results) and revises the prompt.\nGEPA evaluates the revised prompt in a two-step process. First it feeds it to the agent along with the examples used previously and the prompts by other modules. If the revised prompt improves the agent’s performance, GEPA adds it to a pool of candidate prompts and then scores its performance on each example in the benchmark’s validation set.\nFrom the pool, GEPA identifies prompts that achieved the highest score on at least one example. It selects a set of prompts (one for each module) for the next round of revision, prioritizing prompts that excelled on multiple questions.\nGEPA repeats the previous steps until it has exhausted a predefined processing budget. It chooses the set of prompts that achieved the highest average score across all examples in the validation set.\nResults: The authors pitted custom and open-source agents that used GEPA against versions for which Qwen3-8B was fine-tuned on a given benchmark via Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). They measured both the agents’ performance and the number of agent executions required.\nAcross HotpotQA (questions that require reasoning over multiple paragraphs), IFBench (following instructions), HoVer (verifying facts), and PUPA (which gauges balance between helpfulness and unwanted sharing of personal information), agents that used GEPA consistently achieved better performance on all four.\nMoreover, they did this with far greater efficiency, requiring up to 35 times fewer agent executions.\nYes, but: The authors compared GEPA to fine-tuning via reinforcement learning using a single, relatively small model. Questions remain regarding how the results would scale to larger models or generalize to other models, and how GEPA would compare to supervised fine-tuning.\nWhy it matters: Methodically revising prompts can help agents perform better than fine-tuning via reinforcement learning, and it requires far fewer examples and executions.\nWe’re thinking: While it’s unclear how this method compares to supervised fine-tuning, the ability to boost agentic performance without reinforcement learning may be especially valuable in low-data situations or where agent executions are expensive.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 323\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nReaders responded with both surprise and agreement last week when I wrote that the single biggest predictor of how rapidly a team makes progress building an AI agent lay in their ability to drive a disciplined process for evals (measuring the system’s performance) and error analysis (identifying the causes of errors). It’s tempting to shortcut these processes and to quickly attempt fixes to mistakes rather than slowing down to identify the root causes. But evals and error analysis can lead to much faster progress. In this first of a two-part letter, I’ll share some best practices for finding and addressing issues in agentic systems.\nEven though error analysis has long been an important part of building supervised learning systems, it is still underappreciated compared to, say, using the latest and buzziest tools. Identifying the root causes of particular kinds of errors might seem “boring,” but it pays off! If you are not yet persuaded that error analysis is important, permit me to point out:\nTo master a composition on a musical instrument, you don’t only play the same piece from start to end. Instead, you identify where you’re stumbling and practice those parts more.\nTo be healthy, you don’t just build your diet around the latest nutrition fads. You also ask your doctor about your bloodwork to see if anything is amiss. (I did this last month and am happy to report I’m in good health! 😃)\nTo improve your sports team’s performance, you don’t just practice trick shots. Instead, you review game films to spot gaps and then address them.\nTo improve your agentic AI system, don’t just stack up the latest buzzy techniques that just went viral on social media (though I find it fun to experiment with buzzy AI techniques as much as the next person!). Instead, use error analysis to figure out where it’s falling short, and focus on that.\nBefore analyzing errors, we first have to decide what is an error. So the first step is to put in evals. I’ll focus on that for the remainder of this letter and discuss error analysis next week.\nIf you are using supervised learning to train a binary classifier, the number of ways the algorithm could make a mistake is limited. It could output 0 instead of 1, or vice versa. There are also a handful of standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1, ROC, etc. that apply to many problems. So as long as you know the test distribution, evals are relatively straightforward, and much of the work of error analysis lies in identifying what types of input an algorithm fails on, which also leads to data-centric AI techniques for acquiring more data to augment the algorithm in areas where it’s weak.\nWith generative AI, a lot of intuitions from evals and error analysis of supervised learning carry over — history doesn’t repeat itself, but it rhymes — and developers who are already familiar with machine learning and deep learning often adapt to generative AI faster than people who are starting from scratch. But one new challenge is that the space of outputs is much richer, so there are many more ways an algorithm’s output might be wrong.\nTake the example of automated processing of financial invoices where we use an agentic workflow to populate a financial database with information from received invoices. Will the algorithm incorrectly extract the invoice due date? Or the final amount? Or mistake the payer address for the biller address? Or get the financial currency wrong? Or make the wrong API call so the verification process fails? Because the output space is much larger, the number of failure modes is also much larger.\nRather than defining an error metric ahead of time, it is therefore typically more effective to first quickly build a prototype, then manually examine a handful of agent outputs to see where it performs well and where it stumbles. This allows you to focus on building datasets and error metrics — sometimes objective metrics implemented in code, and sometimes subjective metrics using LLM-as-judge — to check the system’s  performance in the dimensions you are most concerned about. In supervised learning, we sometimes tune the error metric to better reflect what humans care about. With agentic workflows, I find tuning evals to be even more iterative, with more frequent tweaks to the evals to capture the wider range of things that can go wrong.\nI discuss this and other best practices in detail in Module 4 of the Agentic AI course we announced last week. After building evals, you now have a measurement of your system’s performance, which provides a foundation for trying different modifications to your agent, as you can now measure what makes a difference. The next step is then to perform error analysis to pinpoint what changes to focus your development efforts on. I’ll discuss this further next week.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn this short course made in collaboration with Google, you’ll build real-time voice agents, from simple to multi-agent podcast systems, using Google’s Agent Development Kit. Enroll for free\nOpenAI, strapped for processing power to drive a worldwide constellation of planned data centers, turned to Nvidia’s archrival AMD.\nWhat’s new: In an unusual deal , OpenAI agreed to purchase what may amount to tens of billions of dollars of AMD Instinct GPUs and received the right to acquire a substantial portion of the chip designer’s shares, essentially for free, if certain conditions are met. The deal, which is to be completed in phases starting next year, covers enough GPUs to draw 6 gigawatts of power (roughly 6 times the city of San Francisco’s peak electricity demand) and up to 10 percent of AMD’s stock. It enables OpenAI to diversify and extend its supply of AI processors to build out a gargantuan size and number of data centers, while AMD secures a top-shelf customer and validates its products as competitors to GPU kingpin Nvidia’s — a huge boost to its credibility and sales in the AI market.\nHow it works: Completion of the financial deal is contingent on both companies reaching specific milestones that are largely undisclosed. OpenAI must hit deployment targets for AMD chips, and AMD’s stock price must hit certain levels.\nOpenAI plans to use AMD’s forthcoming Instinct MI450 data-center GPUs for inference. It will deploy the first batch (enough to consume 1 gigawatt) in a new facility, separate from data centers announced previously, starting next year. Completion of that purchase will unlock the first portion of AMD stock.\nAMD issued a warrant for OpenAI to buy up to 160 million AMD shares, worth more than $35 billion at the company’s current market capitalization, for $0.01 each. The warrant vests as the share price rises to specific levels on their way up to $600 per share, which is roughly three times the current price. If OpenAI acquires all the shares, it will own 10 percent of AMD, potentially enabling it to influence the company’s strategic direction.\nBehind the news: OpenAI’s partnership with AMD is the latest in a series of financial commitments it has made to build data centers that may cost trillions of dollars in coming years. It’s also part of a broader move by big AI companies to secure processing power sufficient to fulfill their ambitions. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI have announced plans to spend more than $350 billion on data centers this year alone, requiring massive spending and tightening the supply of AI chips.\nBig AI’s plans threaten to outstrip the supply of Nvidia’s most capable GPUs. In a February post on the X social network, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said OpenAI was “out of GPUs” and ready to acquire hundreds of thousands more. “It’s hard to overstate how difficult it’s become to get them,” he said.\nAMD holds a 5 percent share of the market for AI accelerators as of late last year, according to an estimate by the investment analyst Jefferies. It has been trying to crack Nvidia’s stranglehold on data-center GPUs since 2018, when it launched its Instinct line.\nOpenAI has been cultivating AMD as an alternative or complement to Nvidia for some time. It already uses AMD’s MI355X and MI300X GPUs on a limited basis and contributed to the design of the MI300x, according to Reuters.\nIn addition, OpenAI announced a plan , starting in the second half of 2026, to deploy 10 gigawatts’ worth of custom chips designed by Broadcom. The plan follows an earlier $10 billion deal for Broadcom to supply custom chips for AI training that would augment, rather than replace, Nvidia GPUs.\nOpenAI’s data centers also need high-bandwidth memory chips. Earlier this month, it announced a deal with Samsung and SK Hynix, which will scale up their manufacturing capacities to serve Stargate , a data-center partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank.\nWhy it matters: AI leaders are racing for position in a market that could reach tens of trillions of dollars by some estimates. OpenAI is leading the charge to build data-center capacity. Its deal with AMD, which has been slowly but steadily encroaching on Nvidia’s dominance in GPUs, takes AMD along for what promises to be a wild ride. That said, it also further exposes both companies to financial risks that worry some observers. OpenAI has taken on substantial debt and its current commitments promise much more. As for AMD, it is giving away 10 percent of itself for the promise of future sales that Lisa Su said would amount to $100 billion considering both OpenAI and other customers it would inspire. The structure of the deal limits the risks and ensures that if the market stalls, both companies will suffer together.\nWe’re thinking: OpenAI’s plans to buy tens of billions of dollars worth of chips for inference supports the notion that demand for AI processing power is shifting from training to inference . Growing usage in general and the rise of agentic workflows in particular suggest that inference is poised for massive expansion, and AMD GPUs, which have relatively large memories, may provide an inference advantage over Nvidia chips in some settings. The more competitive the market for inference, the more likely that the price and speed of token generation will continue to fall — a tremendous boon to AI builders!\nDeepSeek’s latest large language model can cut inference costs by more than half and processes long contexts dramatically faster relative to its predecessor.\nWhat’s new: DeepSeek released weights for DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp , a variation on DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus, which was released in late September. It streamlines processing using a dynamic variation on sparse attention that enables inference speed to scale linearly with input length. The code supports AI chips designed by Huawei, and other Chinese chip designers have adapted it for their products, helping developers in China to use domestic alternatives to U.S.-designed Nvidia GPUs.\nInput/output: Text in (up to 128,000 tokens), text out (up to 8,000 tokens)\nArchitecture: Mixture-of-experts transformer, 685 billion total parameters, approximately 37 billion active parameters per token\nAvailability: Free via web interface or app, weights available for noncommercial and commercial uses under MIT license, $0.28/$0.028/$0.42 per million input/cached/output tokens via API\nPerformance: Comparable to DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus across many benchmarks, processing inputs over 7,000 tokens 2 to 3 times faster\nHow it works: The team modified DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus with a sparse attention mechanism that, rather than attending to the entire input context, selectively processes only the most relevant tokens.\nDuring training, a “lightning indexer,” a weighted similarity function, learned from 2.1 billion tokens of text to predict which tokens DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus’ dense attention mechanism would focus on. Then the team fine-tuned all parameters on around 100 billion tokens of text to work with the indexer’s sparse token selections.\nThe team further fine-tuned the model by distilling five specialist models (versions of the pretrained DeepSeek-V3.2 base fine-tuned for reasoning, math, coding, agentic coding, and agentic search) into DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp.\nThe team applied GRPO to merge reasoning, agentic, and alignment training into a single stage. This approach avoided the catastrophic forgetting problem, in which new learning displaces old, that typically bedevils multi-stage reinforcement learning.\nAt inference, the indexer scores the relevance of each past token to the token being generated. It uses simple operations and FP8 precision (8-bit floating point numbers that are relatively imprecise but require less computation to process) to compute these scores quickly.\nBased on these scores, instead of computing attention across all tokens in the current input context, the model selects and computes attention across the top 2,048 highest-scoring tokens, dramatically reducing computational cost.\nResults: In DeepSeek’s benchmark tests, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp achieved substantial gains in efficiency with modest trade-offs in performance relative to its predecessor DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus.\nDeepSeek-V3.2-Exp cut inference costs for long input contexts by 6 to 7 times compared to DeepSeek-V3.1 Terminus. Processing 32,000 tokens of context, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp cost around $0.10 per 1 million tokens versus $0.60. Processing 128,000 tokens of context, it cost $0.30 per 1 million tokens compared to $2.30.\nDeepSeek-V3.2-Exp showed gains on tasks that involved coding and agentic behavior as well as some math problems. It surpassed DeepSeek-V3.1-Terminus on Codeforces coding challenges (2121 Elo versus 2046 Elo) and BrowseComp the browser-based agentic tasks (40.1 percent versus 38.5 percent). It also surpassed its predecessor on AIME 2025’s competition high-school math problems (89.3 percent versus 88.4 percent), which are more structured and have clearer solutions than those in HMMT (see below).\nHowever, its performance showed slight degradation relative to DeepSeek-V3.2-Terminus across several tasks. It trailed its predecessor on GPQA-Diamond’s graduate-level science questions (79.9 percent versus 80.7 percent), HLE’s abstract-thinking challenges (19.8 percent versus 21.7 percent), HMMT 2025’s competitive high-school math problems (83.6 percent versus 86.1 percent), and Aider-Polyglot’s coding tasks (74.5 percent versus 76.1 percent).\nBehind the news: DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp is among the first large language models to launch with optimizations for domestic chips rather than adding these as an afterthought. The software has been adapted to run on chips by Huawei, Cambricon, and Hygon, following an order by China’s government to domestic AI companies not to use Nvidia chips. The government’s order followed reports that Chinese AI companies had struggled to use domestic chips rather than Nvidia chips, which are subject to U.S. export restrictions.\nWhy it matters: Even as prices have fallen , the cost of processing LLM output tokens can make it prohibitively expensive to perform long-context tasks like analyzing large collections of documents, conversing across long periods of time, and refactoring large code repositories. DeepSeek’s implementation of sparse attention goes some distance toward remedying the issue.\nWe’re thinking: DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp joins Qwen3-Next in experimenting with self-attention alternatives to improve the efficiency of large transformers. While Qwen3-Next combines Gated DeltaNet layers with gated attention layers, DeepSeek-V3.2-Exp uses dynamic sparse attention, suggesting that there’s still more efficiency to be gained by tweaking the transformer architecture.\nThe first offering from Thinking Machines Lab, the startup founded by former OpenAI CTO Mira Murati, aims to simplify — and democratize — the process of fine-tuning AI models.\nWhat’s new: Tinker is an API that streamlines working with multiple GPUs to fine-tune large language models. Users control their algorithms while code behind the scenes handles scheduling, resource allocation, and recovery in case a GPU crashes. You can join a waitlist for free access, but the company plans to start charging in coming weeks. Tinker currently offers a selection of pretrained Qwen3 and Llama 3 models with other open-weights options to come.\nHow it works: The API lets you work as though you were fine-tuning on a single device. You can select a model and write a fine-tuning script that loads your data and specifies a predefined loss function for supervised or reinforcement learning, or you can write your own. Tinker’s software determines, for instance, how to split the model and data among computing clusters. During fine-tuning, the system builds and trains a LoRA adapter (two small matrices that modify a pretrained model’s weights at inference) for the task at hand.\nUsing LoRA also enables the system to share a single pool of compute among multiple fine-tuning runs, which reduces costs.\nA Tinker Cookbook offers implementations of fine-tuning methods.\nBehind the news: Several companies can fine-tune models on your data but don’t give you control over the training loop, similar to the way OpenAI fine-tunes its models on customer data. Libraries like DeepSpeed offer control over fine-tuning while simplifying parallelization across multi-GPU infrastructure, but they require you to manually request GPUs from cloud services (if you don’t have your own) and manage configuration files, which can be complicated.\nWhy it matters: Fine-tuning using multiple GPUs often requires dedicating time to figure out how to allocate resources, debug tricky APIs, and so on. Tinker saves that time, enabling model builders to spend it more productively. Academic researchers, startups, and mid-size companies that want to level up their investment in AI research and/or development are most likely to find it helpful.\nWe’re thinking: Tinker’s use of LoRA  divides the cost of training base models among multiple fine-tuning runs, and potentially among users. This could enable users to experiment more within the a fixed budget.\nRobot control systems that accept only text input struggle to translate words into motions in space. Researchers developed a system that enables robots to plan spatial paths before they execute text instructions.\nWhat’s new: Jason Lee and colleagues at Allen Institute for AI and University of Washington introduced MolmoAct , a robotics action system that improved a 3-jointed robot arm’s ability to manipulate objects and perform multi-step tasks by first estimating spatial depth and planning motion paths. The weights and code are available for noncommercial and commercial uses under the Apache 2 license, while the authors’ fine-tuning dataset is available under CC BY 4.0.\nKey insight: Natural-language instructions don’t translate precisely into spatial directions. Just as humans can navigate more effectively with a map, robots perform more accurately given a sense of 3D space (a depth map) and the desired trajectory (a motion path drawn over a camera’s view). Along with a command like “take the cup off the table and put it in the trash,” the additional information enables a robot to avoid collisions with objects and move more precisely.\nHow it works: MolmoAct uses a SigLIP2 pretrained vision transformer to encode camera images into tokens. Given the image tokens and text instructions, a pretrained Qwen2.5-7B large language model learned to generate tokens that represented (i) a depth map, (ii) a motion path, and  (ii) changes in joint positions.\nThe authors started with 24.3 million robot demonstrations of tasks such as “pick up the water bottle from the drawer and put it on the desk.” Each example included a text instruction, camera views, and changes in joint positions. The authors augmented the examples with depth maps and motion paths.They generated the depth maps using a pretrained Depth Anything 2 , and they produced visual paths by tracking the robot arm’s gripper in the camera images using Molmo , a pretrained vision-language model.\nThey trained Qwen2.5-7B on the augmented dataset. Given a text instruction and camera image, the model learned to generate tokens that represented, in this order, (i) a depth map, (ii) a visual path, and (iii) changes in joint positions.\nTo improve the system’s vision-language understanding, they further pretrained both models on 2 million examples of images and text scraped from the web.\nThe authors fine-tuned the models to generate the next token in more than 2 million examples, which they collected themselves, of robots performing various tasks from start to finish. The examples included various combinations of text instructions, camera views, changes in joint positions, depth maps, and motion paths.\nAt inference, users can see the next motion path before the robot moves and revise it by redrawing it via a tablet. This capability makes the robot’s actions interpretable and enables users to address potential errors before they happen.\nResults: The authors tested MolmoAct’s performance using one or two Franka robotic arms in a simulation as well as 15 real-world tasks, including opening a container, putting trash in a bin, and folding a towel. On average, the system outperformed all other competitors.\nMolmoAct achieved 86.6 percent average success on diverse simulated challenges in LIBERO . The closest competitor, π0-FAST , achieved 85.5 percent average success.\nIn real-world tasks, MolmoAct achieved 0.679 average task progress (a 0-to-1 score that represents how much of each task the robot completed, higher is better), while π0-FAST achieved 0.446 average task progress.\nWhy it matters: Earlier robotic control systems that use LLMs to interpret text instructions map visual input and text instructions directly to low-level actions without explicitly representing 3D space or visual motion paths. MolmoAct's approach makes such systems more precise, adaptable, and explainable.\nWe’re thinking: This robot system is definitely not lost in space !\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn Agentic AI , Andrew Ng teaches you to design multi-step, autonomous workflows in raw Python, covering four design patterns: reflection, tool use, planning, and multi-agent collaboration.

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 322\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nI’m thrilled to announce my latest course: Agentic AI ! This course will get you up to speed building cutting-edge agentic workflows. It is available from DeepLearning.AI here . The only prerequisite is familiarity with Python, though knowing a bit about LLMs helps too.\nThis self-paced course is taught in a vendor-neutral way, using raw Python — without hiding details in a framework. So you’ll learn the core concepts that you can then implement using any popular agentic AI framework, or using no framework.\nSpecifically, you’ll learn how to implement four key agentic design patterns:\nReflection , in which an agent examines its own output and figures out how to improve it\nTool use , in which an LLM-driven application decides which functions to call to carry out web search, access calendars, send email, write code, etc.\nPlanning , where you’ll use an LLM to decide how to break down a task into sub-tasks for execution, and\nMulti-agent collaboration , in which you build multiple specialized agents — much like how a company might hire multiple employees — to perform a complex task.\nMore important, you’ll also learn best practices for building effective agents.\nHaving worked with many teams on many agents, I’ve found that the single biggest predictor of whether someone can build effectively is whether they know how to drive a disciplined process for evals and error analysis. Teams that don’t know how to do this can spend months tweaking agents with little progress to show for it. I’ve seen teams that spent months tuning prompts, building tools for an agent to use, etc., only to hit a performance ceiling they could not break through.\nBut if you understand how to put in evals and how to monitor an agent’s actions at each step (traces) to see when part of its workflow is breaking, you’ll be able to efficiently home in on which components to focus on improving. Instead of guessing what to work on, you'll let evals data guide you.\nYou’ll also learn to take a complex application and systematically decompose it into a sequence of tasks to implement using these design patterns. When you understand this process, you’ll also be better at spotting opportunities to build agents.\nThe course illustrates these concepts with many examples, such as code generation, customer service agents, and automated marketing workflows. We also build a deep research agent that searches for information, summarizes and synthesizes it, and generates a thoughtful report.\nWhen you complete this course, you’ll understand the key building blocks of agents as well as best practices for assembling and tuning these building blocks. This will put you significantly ahead of the vast majority of teams building agents today.\nPlease join me in this course , and let’s build some amazing agents!\nKeep building,\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nAI Dev 25, hosted by Andrew Ng and DeepLearning.AI, heads to New York City! On November 14, join 1,200+ AI developers for a day full of technical keynotes, hands-on workshops, live demos, and a new Fintech Track. Secure your tickets here!\nAnthropic updated its mid-size Claude Sonnet model, making it the first member of the Claude family to reach version 4.5. It also enhanced the Claude Code agentic coding tool with long-desired features.\nClaude Sonnet 4.5: The new model offers a substantial increase in performance as well as a variable budget for reasoning tokens.\nInput/output: Text and images in (up to between 200,000 to 1 million tokens depending on service tier), text out (up to 64,000 tokens)\nAvailability: Free via Claude.ai , API access $3/$15 per million tokens input/output via Anthropic, Amazon Bedrock, and Google Vertex\nFeatures: Reasoning with variable token budget, extended processing time (“hours” according to the documentation), serial (rather than simultaneous) completion of tasks\nKnowledge cutoff: January 2025\nUndisclosed: Model architecture, training data and methods\nResults: In Anthropic’s tests, Claude Sonnet 4.5’s coding metrics stood out, but it performed well on broader assessments, too.\nWith a reasoning budget of 32,000 tokens, Claude Sonnet 4.5 currently tops the LM Arena Text Leaderboard . Without reasoning, it ranks fourth.\nOn coding challenges in SWE-bench Verified, Claude Sonnet 4.5 (82 percent) raised the state of the art, outperforming previous leaders Claude Sonnet 4 (80.2 percent) and Claude Opus 4.1 (79.4 percent).\nIt achieved 61.4 percent on the computer-use benchmark OSWorld , well ahead of other models in available leaderboards.\nIt achieved 100 percent on AIME 2025’s math problems when it used Python tools, although GPT-5 dominated when neither model used tools.\nOn tests of visual reasoning such as GPQA-Diamond and MMMLU, Sonnet 4.5 generally outperformed the larger Claude Opus 4.1 but fell short of Google Gemini Pro 4.5 and OpenAI GPT-5.\nClaude Code: Anthropic’s agentic coding tool got a design overhaul that adds a number of fresh capabilities. Notably, it comes with a software development kit — based on the same software infrastructure, toolkit, orchestration logic, and memory management that underpins Claude Code — for building other agentic tools.\nClaude Agent SDK. The new software development kit pairs Claude models with software tools for web search, file management, code deployment, and other autonomous capabilities. It provides building blocks for all of Claude Code’s functionality so you can build your own agentic applications.\nContext tracking. Agentic use cases require continuity even when inputs exceed a model’s input context limit. When a model’s message history approaches this limit, Claude Code asks the model to summarize the most critical details and passes the summary to the model as the latest input. It also removes tool results when they’re no longer needed, making room for further input.\nMemory. A new API “memory tool” enables the model to store and retrieve especially important information like project states outside the input.\nCheckpoints. Claude Code now stores checkpoints, preserving safe states that it can revert to in case of mistakes. It also added an IDE extension that can be used in VSCode and similar applications in lieu of the terminal.\nBehind the news: Founded by ex-Open AI employees, Anthropic markets itself as an alternative to that company: safer, more humane, and more tasteful. Although it hasn’t stopped touting those values, the emphases have grown simpler: coding and workplace productivity. While ChatGPT may be synonymous with AI among consumers, Anthropic is focusing on software developers and businesses.\nWhy it matters: The coupling of Claude Sonnet 4.5 with the enhanced Claude Code reflects Anthropic’s emphasis on workplace productivity. This focus speaks to some of the business world’s anxieties: When will AI pay off for my workforce? When will it transform what they do? For now, coding (via Claude Code or a competitor) is one obvious answer.\nWe’re thinking: The Claude Agent SDK is a significant release that will enable many developers to build powerful agentic apps. We look forward to an explosion of Claude-based progeny!\nOpenAI and Meta, which have been content to offer standalone chatbots or tuck them into existing products, introduced dueling social video networks and other initiatives designed to boost revenue and engagement.\nWhat’s new: OpenAI’s Sora 2 is a TikTok-style app that lets users share 10-second clips, while Meta’s Vibes enables Facebook users to generate new videos or remix existing ones. In addition, OpenAI launched ChatGPT Pulse , which creates personal briefings based on recent chats and data from connected apps like calendars, and Instant Checkout , which allows ChatGPT users to shop as they chat.\nHow it works: The new initiatives take advantage of existing AI capabilities to boost engagement and bring in revenue.\nSora 2: OpenAI’s social video app, which topped the iOS App Store leaderboard over the weekend, lets users generate a limited number of 10-second, 640x480-pixel clips, while subscribers to ChatGPT Pro ($200 per month) can produce unlimited 20-second, 1920x1080-pixel clips. Users can generate their own likenesses and permit others to do so (as OpenAI CEO Sam Altman did, inspiring his audience to generate clips of him shoplifting GPUs at Target, among other antics). The company tightened restrictions on the use of anime and other characters after rightsholders complained, Altman wrote in a blog post.\nVibes: Meta’s social video feed appears under a free tab in its Meta AI app or on the Vibes web site . Users can’t put themselves into the action, but they can generate clips based on images they upload or remix existing videos in their feed while adding music and altering visual styles. Generated videos can be posted to Instagram and Facebook.\nChatGPT Pulse: Pulse is a new kind of personal news-and-productivity service. It tracks users’ chats, emails, and calendar entries and creates cards designed to anticipate users’ concerns and provide related news, reminders, suggestions, and tips. The service is currently limited to subscribers to ChatGPT Pro, but OpenAI says eventually it will be free for all users in some form.\nInstant Checkout: ChatGPT users who request product recommendations can buy suggested items from Etsy and Shopify without leaving the chatbot’s user interface. OpenAI earns fees on sales, a structure akin to affiliate links that generate revenue for product recommendation services like Wirecutter; the company says its commissions will not influence ChatGPT’s suggestions. Purchases made in ChatGPT are processed via the Agentic Commerce Protocol, a partnership between OpenAI and the payment processor Stripe that is similar to Google’s Agent Payments Protocol .\nBehind the news: For revenue, OpenAI so far has relied on chatbot subscriptions, which account for roughly 80 percent. However, only a tiny fraction of ChatGPT’s 700 million weekly active users subscribe. Tactics such as imposing rate limits persuade some to sign up, but personal productivity, shopping commissions, and advertising offer ways to earn money from the rest.\nWhy it matters: Products based on generative AI are already well established, but they’re still in their infancy, and an infinite variety of AI-powered consumer products and services remains to be invented. OpenAI’s ChatGPT Pulse is a genuinely fresh idea, using agentic capabilities to deliver timely, personalized information and perspective in any domain. Both OpenAI and Facebook are experimenting with social video, giving users new ways to entertain friends and express themselves. And, of course, melding large language models with digital commerce may come to feel natural as people increasingly turn to chatbots for purchasing advice.\nWe’re thinking: The financial success of such AI-driven products is bound to have a powerful impact on future directions of AI research and development.\nAlibaba rounded out the Qwen3 family with its biggest large language model to date as well as smaller models that process text, images, video, and/or audio.\nWhat’s new: The closed-weights Qwen3-Max gives Alibaba a foothold among the biggest large language models. Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B is an open-weights model that processes text, images, and video at the top of its size class and beyond. Qwen3-Omni , also open-weights, adds audio to the mix with outstanding results.\nQwen3-Max encompasses 1 trillion parameters trained on 36 trillion tokens. It’s available in base and instruction-tuned versions, with a reasoning version to come. Like Alibaba’s other Max models (but unlike most of the Qwen series), its weights are not available.\nInput/output: Text in (up to 262,000 tokens), text out (up to 65,536 tokens)\nArchitecture and training: 1 trillion-parameter mixture-of-experts decoder, specific training data and methods undisclosed\nPerformance: In Alibaba’s tests, Qwen3-Max generally fell short of Google Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI GPT-5 but outperformed large models from Anthropic, DeepSeek, and xAI. On Artificial Analysis’ Intelligence Index , it scored just behind the smaller Qwen3-235B-A22B.\nAvailability: API access $1.20/$6.00 per 1 million input/output tokens via Alibaba Cloud in Singapore , $0.861/$3.441 per 1 million input/output tokens via Alibaba Cloud in Beijing\nQwen3-VL-235B-A22B , a vision-language variant of Qwen3-235B-A22B, is designed to drive agentic interactions that require understanding of images and videos. It comes in base, instruction-tuned, and reasoning versions.\nInput/output: Text, images, video in (up to 262,000 tokens, expandable to 1 million tokens), text out (up to 81,920 tokens)\nArchitecture and training: Mixture-of-experts decoder (235 billion parameters total, 22 billion active per token), vision encoder, specific training data and methods undisclosed\nPerformance: In Alibaba’s tests, Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B outperformed other open-weights models and generally matched the best available models on many image and video benchmarks, with or without reasoning capability. It established new states of the art among both open and closed models for MathVision (math problems), Design2Code (visual coding tests), and several tests of text recognition. It outperformed Gemini 2.5 Pro and OpenAI GPT-5 on tests of agentic capabilities (ScreenSpot Pro, OSWorldG, Android World), document understanding (MMLongBench-Doc, DocVQATest), and 2D/3D spatial awareness (CountBench). It performed second-best only to Gemini Pro 2.5 on the science, technology, and math portions of MMMU-Pro, visual reasoning puzzles in SimpleVQA, and video understanding challenges in VideoMMMU.\nAvailability: Free for commercial and noncommercial uses under Apache 2.0 license, $0.70/$2.80 per 1 million tokens input/output via Alibaba Cloud\nQwen3-Omni-30B-A3B was pretrained on text, images, video, and audio, so it translates between them directly. It comes in instruction-tuned and reasoning versions as well as a specialized audio/video captioner model.\nInput/output: Text, images, video, or audio in (up to 65,536 tokens), text or spoken-word audio out (up to 16,384 tokens)\nArchitecture and training: Mixture-of-experts transformer (30 billion parameters total, 3 billion active per token), specialized experts for multimodal and speech processing, specific training data and methods undisclosed\nPerformance: Qwen3-Omni is the best-performing open-weights voice model, outperforming GPT-4o on many tests. Among 36 audio and audio-visual benchmarks, Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B achieved state-of-the-art results on 22. In tests of mixed media understanding and voice output, its results were competitive with those of Gemini 2.5 Pro, ByteDance Seed-ASR , and OpenAI GPT-4o Transcribe.\nAvailability: Free for commercial and noncommercial uses under Apache 2.0 license, $0.52/$1.99 per 1 million tokens of text input/output, $0.94/$3.67 per 1 million tokens of image-video input/text output, $4.57/$18.13 per 1 million tokens of audio input/output via Alibaba Cloud\nBehind the news: Alibaba recently released Qwen3-Next , which accelerates performance by alternating attention and Gated DeltaNet layers. The new models don’t use this architecture, but it remains a potential path for future models in the Qwen family.\nWhy it matters: While Qwen3-Max falls short of competitors, the new open-weights multimodal models offer opportunities for developers. Qwen3-VL-235B-A22B offers low cost, versatility, and customizability, and Qwen3-Omni-30B-A3B provides a welcome option for voice applications. Alibaba has been a consistent, versatile experimenter that has put open releases first, and its new releases cover a wide range of needs.\nWe’re thinking: We love to see open-weights models turning in world-beating results! With their prowess in multimedia understanding, reasoning, and tool use, Qwen3-VL and Qwen3-Omni put a wide range of agentic applications within reach of all developers.\nThe approach known as LoRA streamlines fine-tuning by training a small adapter that modifies a pretrained model’s weights at inference. Researchers built a model that generates such adapters directly.\nWhat’s new: Rujikorn Charakorn and colleagues at the Tokyo-based startup Sakana AI introduced Text-to-LoRA , a model that produces task-specific LoRA adapters based on natural language descriptions of tasks to be performed by a separate large language model.\nKey insight: Typically, a LoRA adapter is trained for a particular task. However, a model can learn, given a description of a task, to generate a suitable adapter for tasks it may not have encountered in its training.\nHow it works: The authors trained a vanilla neural network, given text that describes a task, to produce a task-specific LoRA adapter for the large language model Mistral-7B-Instruct.\nThe authors trained the network on 479 tasks such as answering questions about physics and solving math word problems. Each task consisted of 128 example input-output pairs and a description like this one for solving math word problems: “This task challenges your problem-solving abilities through mathematical reasoning. You must carefully read each scenario and systematically work through the data to compute the final outcome.”\nThey generated embeddings of task descriptions by passing them to gte-large-en-v1.5 , a pretrained embedding model.\nGiven an embedding of a task description and embeddings that specified layers of Mistral-7B-Instruct to adapt, Text-to-LoRA learned to generate a LoRA adapter. Specifically, it learned to minimize the difference between the outputs of the LoRA-adapted Mistral-7B-Instruct and the ground truth outputs.\nResults: The authors evaluated Mistral-7B-Instruct with Text-to-LoRA on 10 reasoning benchmarks (such as BoolQ , Hellaswag , and WinoGrande ). They compared the results to Mistral-7B-Instruct (i) with conventional task-specific adapters, (ii) with a single adapter trained on all 479 training tasks simultaneously, (iii) unadapted but with the task description prepended to the prompt, and (iv) unadapted but with a plain prompt.\nAcross all benchmarks, Mistral-7B-Instruct with Text-to-LoRA achieved 67.7 percent average accuracy. The LLM with the multi-task adapter achieved 66.3 percent. The unadapted LLM with the task description prepended to the prompt achieved 60.6 percent average accuracy, while a plain prompt yielded 55.8 percent.\nComparing their work against conventional LoRA adapters, the authors reported results on 8 tasks (excluding GSM8K and HumanEval). Mistral-7B-Instruct with conventional adapters did best (75.8 percent). The LLM with Text-to-LoRA achieved 73.9 percent average accuracy, with the 479-task adapter 71.9 percent, and with no adapter 60.0 percent.\nWhy it matters: The demands placed on a model often change over time, and training new LoRA adapters to match is cumbersome. In effect, Text-to-LoRA compresses a library of LoRA adapters into a parameter-efficient hypernetwork that generalizes to arbitrary tasks. Because it generates them based on text descriptions, different descriptive phrasing can produce different styles of adaptation to emphasize, say, reasoning, format, or other constraints. In this way, Text-to-LoRA makes it easy, quick, and inexpensive to produce new adapters for idiosyncratic or shifting tasks.\nWe’re thinking: Training LoRA adaptors typically involves a tradeoff between specialization and generalization, and ensembles or mixtures of adapters can improve generalization. This approach offers an efficient, low-cost way to produce LoRA ensembles, which typically are expensive to train and maintain.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 321\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nLandingAI’s Agentic Document Extraction (ADE) turns PDF files into LLM-ready markdown text. I’m excited about this tool providing a powerful building block for developers to use in applications in financial services, healthcare, logistics, legal, insurance, and many other sectors.\nBefore LLMs, many documents sat on individuals’ laptops or in businesses’ cloud storage buckets unexamined, because we did not have software that could make sense of them. But now that LLMs can make sense of text, there’s significant value in getting information out of the numerous PDF documents, forms, and slide decks we’ve stored for processing — if we are able to extract the information in them accurately. For example:\nHealthcare: Streamlining patient intake by accurately extracting data from complex medical forms\nFinancial services: Accurately extracting data from complex financial statements such as a company’s public filings, which might include financial tables with thousands of cells, for analysis\nLogistics: Extracting data from shipment orders and custom forms to track or expedite shipping\nLegal: Enable automated contract review by accurately extracting key clauses from complex legal documents\nAccurate extraction of data is important in many valuable applications. However, achieving accuracy is not easy.\nFurther, even though LLMs hallucinate, our intuition is still that computers are good at math. Some of the most disconcerting mistakes I’ve seen a computer make have been when a system incorrectly extracted figures from a large table of numbers or complex form and output a confident-sounding but incorrect financial figure. Because our intuition tells us that computers are good at numbers (after all, computers are supposed to be good at computing!), I’ve seen users find silent failures in the form of incorrect numerical outputs particularly hard to catch.\nHow can we accurately extract information from large PDF files? Humans don’t just glance at a document and reach a conclusion on that basis. Instead, they iteratively examine different parts of the document to pull out information piece by piece. An agentic workflow can do the same.\nADE iteratively decomposes complex documents into smaller sections for careful examination. It uses a new custom model we call the Document Pre-trained Transformer (DPT); more details are in this video . For example, given a complex document, it might extract a table and then further extract the table structure, identifying rows, columns, merged cells, and so on. This breaks down complex documents into smaller and easier subproblems for processing, resulting in much more accurate results.\nToday, a lot of dark data — data that has been collected but is not used — is locked up in documents. ADE, which you can call using just ~3 simple lines of code, accurately extracts this information for analysis or processing by AI. You can learn more about it here . I hope many developers will think of cool applications to build with this.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM RAPIDFIRE.AI\nRun 20x more experiments using the same resources, even on a single GPU! RapidFire AI is open source software for efficient model training. Run configs in hyper-parallel with live control and automatic orchestration. Get started: pip install rapidfireai\nA flurry of announcements brought into sharper focus OpenAI’s plans to build what may amount to trillions of dollars of global computing capacity.\nWhat’s new: OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank, the primary partners in the massive data-center buildout called Stargate, announced 5 new sites in the United States that entail $400 billion in spending in addition to its prior commitments. In addition, OpenAI introduced Stargate UK, a partnership with Nvidia and the Norwegian data-center builder Nscale that will build AI infrastructure in England. All told, OpenAI’s current plans will cost $1 trillion, The Wall Street Journal reported .\nHow it works: OpenAI forecasts demand for data centers in terms of electrical power they will consume. Each 1-gigawatt increment of capacity (roughly enough to light 100 million LED bulbs) costs around $50 billion to build. The company’s current plans amount to 20 gigawatts worldwide, and it predicts demand as high as 100 gigawatts, according to one executive. To satisfy that level of demand would bring the total outlay to $5 trillion (roughly the gross domestic product of Germany).\nOpenAI will build 1.5 gigawatts of new capacity in Ohio (piggybacking on a previous SoftBank project) and Texas over the coming 18 months. This capacity adds to 5.5 gigawatts in New Mexico, a different site in Texas, and an unnamed location in the Midwest. These newly announced facilities complement a 1.2-gigawatt set of eight data centers  in Abilene, Texas, two of which are up and running. Oracle will oversee construction, and Oracle and Softbank will provide financing.\nThe UK project calls for multiple sites, starting with Cobalt Park near Newcastle, that will enable OpenAI to supply computing power for finance, national security, and other applications that need to be processed domestically. Nvidia will supply GPUs that may amount to 8,000 early next year and as many as 31,000 afterward.\nSeparate from the Stargate announcements, Nvidia pledged to invest $100 billion in OpenAI, following a recent $40 billion infusion from SoftBank, Microsoft, and others as well as an earlier $13 billion from Microsoft. Nvidia provided the first $10 billion at a valuation of $500 billion, raising its stake in OpenAI by roughly 2 percent after an undisclosed investment last year. The outlay is likely to return to Nvidia directly in the form of sales or leases of chips, The Information reported\nBehind the news: Stargate, a partnership between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank to build 20 data centers over four years at a cost of $500 billion, began in January. That plan is proceeding ahead of schedule and has expanded considerably.\nWith the latest announcements, the initial commitment is more than 80 percent underway.\nStargate includes further 1-gigawatt initiatives in India and the United Arab Emirates , with more countries under consideration.\nOpenAI’s arrangement with Oracle includes a commitment to pay the latter $30 billion annually for computing services.\nYes, but: Some analysts worry that giant infrastructure commitments by big AI companies could jeopardize their financial health if demand for AI doesn’t keep pace. “Someone is going to lose a phenomenal amount of money,” OpenAI CEO Sam Altman told The Verge , adding that winners will gain even more.\nWhy it matters: Big AI’s capital spending continues to rise. In addition to Stargate, Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft together plan to spend more than $325 billion this year on data centers, with much more to come. This outsized effort brings with it outsized risks: Companies are betting their balance sheets, investors are putting money on the line, governments are hoping that data centers will supercharge their economies, energy providers are scrambling to provide sufficient electricity, and communities are balancing potential prosperity versus environmental hazard. The optimistic view sees AI’s value rising, costs falling, social benefits spreading, and energy use declining as AI models produce higher-quality output with greater efficiency.\nWe’re thinking: $5 trillion spent on AI infrastructure is more than 10 times OpenAI’s latest valuation. But the company’s valuation has increased by more than 20 times since it launched ChatGPT in 2022. So far, its bets are paying off.\nResearchers used AI models to create novel viruses from scratch.\nWhat’s new: Samuel King and colleagues at the nonprofit biotech lab Arc Institute, Stanford University, and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center used model architectures related to transformers, trained on DNA sequences rather than text, to synthesize viruses that fight a common bacterial infection.\nKey insight: The class of models known as genomic language models can produce DNA sequences by generating chains of nucleotides, the building blocks of DNA. Typically such models produce sequences up to the length of a single gene, of which many are required to make a genome. But fine-tuning such models on sequences associated with a family of viruses can enable them to produce longer sequences within that family. At inference, feeding the fine-tuned model the initial part of the genome of a virus from the fine-tuned family can prompt the model to generate an entire novel genome.\nHow it works: The authors fine-tuned existing genome language models on the genomes of 14,500 viruses in the Microviridae family of bacteriophages, viruses that kill specific bacteria. Using the fine-tuned models, they generated potential viral genomes similar to Microviridae, identified the most promising ones, and synthesized them.\nThe authors started with Evo 1 (a 7 billion-parameter StripedHyena architecture pretrained on 2.7 million bacterial and viral genomes) and Evo 2 (a 7 billion-parameter StripedHyena 2 architecture pretrained on 8.8 trillion tokens from viral, bacterial, plant, and animal genomes). The StripedHyena architectures blend transformer-like self-attention layers that encode long-range dependencies with convolution-like  blocks, enabling them to read and generate long DNA sequences efficiently.\nThe authors generated 11,000 candidate genomes by prompting the models with the first 11 nucleotides in the genome of the virus ΦX174, a relatively simple member of the Microviridae family that kills the bacterium E. coli C by making it burst.\nThey used existing tools for DNA sequence interpretation to filter the candidates, keeping those that were (i) likely to produce novel proteins, (ii) likely to produce proteins that would bind to E. Coli C, (iii) around the same length as ΦX174’s genome, and (iv) made up of the most common nucleotides. This left 302 genomes.\nThey successfully synthesized 285 of the 302 generated candidates.\nResults: The authors tested a cocktail of 16 synthetic viruses on 3 bacterial strains that are resistant to ΦX174. Initially, the cocktail failed to kill the bacteria within three hours. However, when they moved the viruses to new cultures of the same bacterial strain to give them opportunities to recombine and mutate, the bacteria succumbed.\nIn three side-by-side contests, the synthetic virus called Evo-Φ69 replicated in host cells more than ΦX174 and other synthetic viruses. Six hours after infecting its host, the population of Evo-Φ69 had increased between 16 times and 65 times its initial level, while the population of ΦX174 had increased between 1.3 times and 4.0 times.\nIn a test that tracked cloudiness of the liquid bacterial culture, a proxy for the density of the bacterial population, Evo-Φ2483 reduced the culture’s cloudiness to 0.07 optical density in 135 minutes, while ΦX174 achieved 0.22 optical density in 180 minutes.\nMany of the synthetic viruses qualified as new species, meaning their genomes were no more than 95 percent identical to those of the nearest naturally occurring viruses.\nBehind the news: Genome engineering typically relies on selective breeding, introducing random mutations, or making specific changes based on known biology, all of which modify existing genomes instead of designing new ones. These approaches struggle to change features like genome lengths and the speed at which bacteriophages kill bacterial cells.\nWhy it matters: Bacteriophage therapy is a potential alternative to antibiotics. However, bacteria can evolve resistance bacteriophages, just as they develop resistance to antibiotics. In this work, AI generated genomes for viable, diverse, novel synthetic bacteriophages that defeated resistant bacteria. This approach could give doctors a fresh approach to fighting bacterial infections.\nWe’re thinking: Making new viruses from scratch is cause for both excitement and concern. On one hand, the implications for medicine and other fields are enormous. On the other, although the authors took care to produce viruses that can’t infect humans, malicious actors may not. Research into responding to biological threats is as critical as research that enables us to create such threats.\nA Swedish organization that collects royalties on behalf of songwriters and record companies has formed a technology-legal-business ecosystem designed to allow AI developers to use music legally while compensating publishers of recordings and compositions.\nWhat’s new: STIM, which collects royalties on behalf of over 100,000 composers and recording artists, devised a license for use of musical works to train AI models. Sureel , a Swedish startup, provides technology that calculates the influence of a given training example on a model’s output. The music-generation startup Songfox is the first licensee.\nHow it works: STIM considers its deal with Songfox a pilot project that will shape future licensing arrangements. Members of the organization can license their music if they (i) opt in to allowing AI developers to use it and (ii) distribute it via STIM’s music-by-subscription subsidiary Cora Music .\nSTIM members must register their works with Sureel. Registration forbids AI developers from training models on those works by default. To license registered works, publishers must opt in and developers must agree to the terms.\nThe license grants licensees — typically AI companies that seek to train a music generator on licensed works — the right to copy recordings and their underlying compositions for the purpose of training one version of a model. Further licenses are required for further versions. Licensees can distribute generated music via subscription services, but they must obtain separate licenses for television, radio, advertising, or films.\nSureel uses proprietary technology to determine the influence of a given work on a given generated output. The technology, which must be integrated with a model during training, learns “static attribution vectors” that help determine a percentage of influence on the model’s output of any given training example, according to a patent .\nWhen an AI developer uses licensed works, the rights holders will divide a licensing fee based on the number of their works used, the size of the AI developer’s business, and other factors. They will also receive unspecified shares of revenue from the uses of the AI model and the generated music. (The license is new enough that no concrete examples of such payments are available.)\nYes, but: To take advantage of the license, AI developers must integrate Sureel’s attribution technology into their model training process. Consequently, the STIM license is not useful for artists that aim to collect revenue from music-generation companies such as Suno and Udio , which trained their models without Sureel’s involvement.\nBehind the news: Owners of copyrights to creative works have sued AI companies for training models on their works without permission, but the likely outcomes of such lawsuits are uncertain.\nSony Music, Universal Music Group, and Warner Music — the world’s three largest music companies — are pursuing a lawsuit against Suno and Udio, makers of web-based music generators, for alleged copyright violations. Similarly, the German music-rights organization GEMA is suing Suno .\nLaws in the United States do not address whether or not the training an AI model on a copyrighted work requires the copyright owner’s permission. This leaves the question to be decided by courts or further action by lawmakers.\nEurope’s AI Act provides for artists to make their works unavailable for training AI systems, but music-industry organizations say this provision doesn’t work, and artists have no redress if their works were used to train AI systems before the AI Act took effect.\nWhy it matters: It remains to be seen whether allowing AI models to learn from copyrighted works is considered fair use under the laws of many countries. Regardless, the current uncertainly over the interpretation of existing laws opens AI companies to potential liability for claims that they have infringed copyrights. Licensing could help to insulate AI developers from legal risk and incentivize creative people to continue to produce fresh works on which to train next-generation models. The STIM license is an early effort to find a formula that works for both parties.\nWe’re thinking: As technology has evolved from recording to broadcast to streaming, the avenues for musicians to profit from their work have increased, and we expect AI to continue to expand the options.\nResearchers built a model that integrates satellite imagery and other sensor readings across the entire surface of the Earth to reveal patterns of climate, land use, and other features.\nWhat’s new: Christopher F. Brown, Michal R. Kazmierski, Valerie J. Pasquarella, and colleagues at Google built AlphaEarth Foundations (AEF), a model that produces embeddings that represent every 10-meter-square spot on the globe for each year between 2017 and 2024. The embeddings can be used to track a wide variety of planetary characteristics such as humidity, precipitation, or vegetation and global challenges such as food production, wildfire risk, or reservoir levels. You can download them here for commercial and noncommercial uses under a CC BY 4.0 license . Google offers financial grants to researchers who want to use them.\nKey insight: During training, feeding a model one data type limits its performance. On the other hand, feeding it too many types can cause it to learn spurious patterns. A sensible compromise is feeding it the smallest set of input data types that contain most of the relevant information.\nHow it works: The authors used three data types — optical, radar, and thermal videos taken by satellites— as training inputs, but the loss terms referred to several others . Given the three types of satellite videos, each of which represented around 1.28 square kilometers, AEF encoded each video using unspecified encoders. It fed the encoded video to a custom module that integrated both self-attention (within and across frames) and convolutional layers. The architecture enabled the model to produce embeddings that represented each 10x10-meter area over the course of a year. To learn to produce good embeddings, the team trained the model using 4 loss terms:\nThe first loss term encouraged the model to reconstruct multiple data types: the 3 inputs as well as elevation maps, climate maps, gravity maps, and images labeled with environment types like “wetland.” For each embedding produced by the model, separate vanilla neural networks reconstructed these data types. For example, for each embedding, the system produced a pixel of a thermal video.\nThe second loss term encouraged the embeddings to follow the uniform distribution, ensuring that they weren’t all alike. This suited them for clustering and other common approaches.\nThe third loss term encouraged the model to produce identical embeddings when given the input with a part missing as it did when given the entire input. This enabled the model to make good embeddings even if some — or all — frames were missing from an optical, radar, or thermal video.\nThe fourth loss term encouraged the model to produce similar embeddings to those of text tagged with matching geographic coordinates from Wikipedia and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility , such as geotagged text about landmarks or animal populations. Conversely, it encouraged the model to produce embeddings unlike those of text corresponding to geographic coordinates that differed (following CLIP ). To produce text embeddings, the authors used a frozen version of Gemini followed by a vanilla neural network that learned to help match Gemini’s embeddings and AEF’s.\nTo adapt AEF for classification or regression, they trained a linear model, given an embedding from AEF, to classify or estimate the labels on a few hundred examples from the test dataset.\nResults: The authors compared AEF to 9 alternatives, including manually designed approaches to embedding satellite imagery such as MOSAIKS and CCDC as well as learned models like SatCLIP . Across 11 datasets, AEF outperformed the alternatives by a significant margin.\nClassifying crops in Canada , AEF achieved around 51 percent accuracy, while the next-best approach, CCDC, achieved around 47 percent accuracy.\nClassifying changes from one type of environment to another (for example from grass to water), AEF achieved 78.4 percent accuracy, while next-best approach, MOSAIKS, achieved 72 percent accuracy.\nEstimating the amount of water per area transferred from land to atmosphere over a month, AEF achieved roughly 12 millimeters mean square error, while MOSAIKS achieved roughly 18 millimeters mean square error.\nWhy it matters: Satellites examine much of Earth’s surface, but their output is fragmentary (due to cloud cover and orbital coverage) and difficult to integrate. Machine learning can pack a vast range of overhead data into a comprehensive set of embeddings that can be used with Google’s own Earth Engine system and other models. By embedding pixels, AEF makes it easier to map environmental phenomena and track changes over time, and the 10x10-meter resolution offers insight into small-scale features of Earth’s surface. The team continues to collect data, revise the model, and publish updated embeddings.\nWe’re thinking: This project brings AI to the whole world!\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 320\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nLast week, China barred its major tech companies from buying Nvidia chips. This move received only modest attention in the media, but has implications far beyond what’s widely appreciated. Specifically, it signals that China has progressed sufficiently in semiconductors to break away from dependence on advanced chips designed in the U.S., the vast majority of which are manufactured in Taiwan. It also highlights the U.S. vulnerability to possible disruptions in Taiwan at a moment when China is becoming less vulnerable.\nAfter the U.S. started restricting AI chip sales to China, China dramatically ramped up its semiconductor research and investment to move toward self-sufficiency. These efforts are starting to bear fruit, and China’s willingness to cut off Nvidia is a strong sign of its faith in its domestic capabilities. For example, the new DeepSeek-R1-Safe model was trained on 1000 Huawei Ascend chips. While individual Ascend chips are significantly less powerful than individual Nvidia or AMD chips, Huawei’s system-level design approach to orchestrating how a much larger number of chips work together seems to be paying off. For example, Huawei’s CloudMatrix 384 system of 384 chips aims to compete with Nvidia’s GB200, which uses 72 higher-capability chips.\nToday, U.S. access to advanced semiconductors is heavily dependent on Taiwan’s TSMC, which manufactures the vast majority of the most advanced chips. Unfortunately, U.S. efforts to ramp up domestic semiconductor manufacturing have been slow. I am encouraged that one fab at the TSMC Arizona facility is now operating, but issues of workforce training, culture, licensing and permitting, and the supply chain are still being addressed, and there is still a long road ahead for the U.S. facility to be a viable substitute for manufacturing in Taiwan.\nIf China gains independence from Taiwan manufacturing significantly faster than the U.S., this would leave the U.S. much more vulnerable to possible disruptions in Taiwan, whether through natural disasters or man-made events. If manufacturing in Taiwan is disrupted for any reason and Chinese companies end up accounting for a large fraction of global semiconductor manufacturing capabilities, that would also help China gain tremendous geopolitical influence.\nDespite occasional moments of heightened tensions and large-scale military exercises, Taiwan has been mostly peaceful since the 1960s. This peace has helped the people of Taiwan to prosper and allowed AI to make tremendous advances, built on top of chips made by TSMC. I hope we will find a path to maintaining peace for many decades more.\nBut hope is not a plan. In addition to working to ensure peace, practical work lies ahead to multi-source, build more chip fabs in more nations, and enhance the resilience of the semiconductor supply chain. Dependence on any single manufacturer invites shortages, price spikes, and stalled innovation the moment something goes sideways.\nKeep building,\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nBuild a data agent that plans steps, connects to various data sources, and self-corrects based on evaluations.

Enroll for free!\nGoogle launched an open protocol for agentic payments that enables agents based on any large language model to purchase items over the internet.\nWhat’s new: Agent Payments Protocol (AP2) is designed for buyers and sellers to securely initiate, authorize, and close purchases. AP2 works with Google’s A2A and Anthropic’s similar MCP, open protocols that instruct agents or provide access to data and APIs. It manages diverse payment types including credit cards, bank transfers, digital payments, and cryptocurrency.\nHow it works: Agentic payments pose challenges to security, such as manipulation by malicious actors, and liability, particularly with respect to whether a user or agent is to blame for mistakes. AP2 aims to solve these problems by using cryptographically signed contracts called mandates. Three distinct mandates record the terms of the purchase, its fulfillment, and the user’s authorization of payment. If a fraudulent or incorrect transaction occurs, the payment processor can consult this record to see which party is accountable. To buy an item using AP2:\nAn intent mandate specifies rules for the purchase such as price limits, timing, and the item’s attributes. It may create an intent mandate while a user is present or ahead of time. For instance, if a buyer instructs an agent to “buy [brand and model] running shoes the moment they go on sale,” the agent will prompt the user to specify and authorize the terms of the mandate, such as the desired top price, size, and color.\nA cart mandate covers the other end of the sale. This contract describes the contents of the virtual shopping cart including a description of items sold, their prices, and terms of the deal.\nA payment mandate tells a payment network (a financial institution plus payment processor that moves funds electronically) that the transaction was authorized by a user or an agent, so it can complete the transaction.\nBehind the news: Many companies have experimented with agentic payments with varying degrees of success. For example, last year Stripe launched an agentic payment toolkit that issues a one-time debit card for each purchase. This approach reduces risk, but it requires Stripe’s payment system, particular models, and specific agentic frameworks. Google’s approach is more comprehensive, initially including more than 60 partners including payment processors, financial institutions, and software giants.\nWhy it matters: AP2 opens up automated sales in which any participant can buy and sell, and it does this in a standardized, flexible way. For instance, a user could tell an agent to book a vacation in a specific location with a specific budget. The agent could transmit those requirements to many sellers’ agents that might assemble customized packages to meet the user’s demands. Then the user’s agent could either present the packages to the user or choose one itself. The buyer would get the vacation they want and the seller would make a valuable sale, while AI did the haggling.\nWe’re thinking: The internet didn’t make travel agents obsolete, it made them agentic!\nWhat do ChatGPT’s 700 million weekly active users do with it? OpenAI teamed up with a Harvard economist to find out.\nWhat’s new: ChatGPT users are turning to the chatbot increasingly for personal matters rather than work, and the gender balance of the user base is shifting, OpenAI found in a large-scale study. “How People Use ChatGPT,” a preliminary report published by the National Bureau of Economic Research, is available in return for an institutional email address.\nHow it works: The study examined 1.58 million messages entered by users and drawn at random from over 1.1 million conversations between May 2024 and July 2025.\nThe messages were written by logged-in users over 18 who used consumer-level (as opposed to business) subscriptions.\nThe authors classified users by gender (based on names the authors deemed typically masculine, feminine, or indeterminate), self-reported age, and geography.\nThey classified messages by topic, general intention (such as asking for information or requesting action), and specific task (such as writing or coding).\nResults: Most users of ChatGPT were young adults, and apparently more women are joining their ranks. Uses shifted from work to more personal tasks over the course of the study period. Writing and guidance were most popular uses, followed closely by seeking information.\nChatGPT was most popular with users between 18 and 25 years old, who sent 46 percent of the messages. Users between 26 and 66 were more likely to use ChatGPT for work.\nWomen may now outnumber men using ChatGPT. Messages from users with names classified as typically feminine increased from 37 percent in January 2024 to 52 percent by June 2025.\nMessages categorized as asking were more common than messages categorized as doing (requests for generated output such as plans, writing, or code) or expressing (such as idle conversation, reflection, or playing a role). The most common requests were for practical guidance (28.3 percent) or writing (28.1 percent), while seeking information was nearly as popular (21.3 percent).\nUses of ChatGPT for personal matters rose. In June 2024, messages divided roughly equally between work and non-work uses. By July 2025, roughly 73 percent of them likely were not related to work. (Overall use grew during that time. The number of likely non-work messages increased by around 8 times, while the number of work-related messages increased by more than 3 times.)\nAmong non-work uses, the most common were seeking information (24.4 percent) or practical guidance (28.8 percent). When ChatGPT was used for work, the most common use was writing, mostly requests to edit, critique, translate, or otherwise transform existing text rather than produce all-new text.\nBehind the news: OpenAI said its report is the largest study of chatbot usage undertaken to date, but its peers have published similar research. Anthropic released its third Economic Index , which analyzes consumer and business use of its Claude models. Anthropic’s study shows that Claude API users are much more likely to automate tasks than consumer users. Claude is used overwhelmingly for computational and mathematical tasks, but education, arts and media, and office and administrative support are steadily rising.\nWhy it matters: In OpenAI’s study (and Anthropic’s), AI users and uses are becoming more diverse. The initial user of AI chatbots was disproportionately likely to be based in the U.S., highly educated, highly paid, male, young, and focused on technology. Nearly 3 years after ChatGPT’s introduction, they are far more varied, as are their wants, needs, and expectations.\nWe’re thinking: Early on, it seemed as though large language models would be most useful for work. But people are using them to seek information and advice about personal matters, plan their lives, and express themselves. It turns out that we need more intelligence in our whole lives, not just at the office.\nAI agents are getting in on the action of online sports gambling.\nWhat’s new: Several startups cater to betting customers by offering AI-powered sports analysis, chat, and tips, Wired reported . Some established gambling operations are adding AI capabilities to match.\nHow it works: Most AI sports-betting startups analyze which bets are the most statistically likely to pay off based on publicly available data. Increasingly, agents suggest specific bets. Only a few take bets from users and pay winnings to them, and fewer offer agents that actively place bets on third-party web sites on a user’s behalf.\nMonster.bet hosts MonsterGPT, a GPT-style chatbot that uses retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to gather sports data from across the web while a proprietary algorithm predicts winners. The chatbot allows bettors to ask questions, and a history function tracks the results of bets they place and tailors its analysis to their strategies. Access to Monster costs $77 a month.\nRithmm, based in Massachusetts, allows users to create their own “prediction models” using no-code tools. It also focuses on “prop bets” (not whether a team will win a game, but whether a player will achieve a particular outcome like score a touchdown). Subscriptions start at $30 a month.\nWith roots in fantasy sports, FanDuel is an older sports-betting operation that has integrated AI. Unlike many competitors, it takes bets and pays winnings. The mobile app integrates a chatbot called AceAI that helps users construct bets that require more than one event to occur; for example, that football champions Argentina will win a particular match and their star Lionel Messi will score at least one goal.\nSire (formerly DraiftKing [sic]) uses an agentic approach. AI agents currently have limited access to bank accounts and other payment services like PayPal or Venmo, so Sire’s agents place bets using a crypto wallet. This enables an agent to react to events within a match and place bets automatically faster than a human can. For example, if a tennis player serves an ace, an automated bet can be made that the next serve will also be an ace. But instead of placing separate bets by individual bettors, Sire sells shares to customers who divide any profits from a wide range of bets.\nFew other betting agents have succeeded. The blockchain platform Zilliqa developed an agent called Ava for picking horse-race winners but abandoned it because synchronizing the agent, crypto wallets, and betting sites — all of which operate independently — was too slow. Some other purportedly agentic tools, including one called WagerGPT, collapsed under inflated promises.\nBehind the news: Most AI gambling startups are based in the United States, where online betting recently became legal. In 2024, Americans bet over $150 billion on legal sports wagers, up 22 percent from 2023. The share of online betting has grown steadily from 25 percent of the total in 2024 to 30 percent in 2025 and shows no sign of slowing down.\nWhy it matters: Online gambling is an AI laboratory that uses nearly every emerging element of the technology. It requires quantitative reasoning to analyze bets, RAG to scour sports statistics and other relevant information, classification models to identify potentially profitable bets, and payment agents to place bets automatically. As these technologies advance, betting analysis and tools will advance with them.\nWe’re thinking: Whether you gamble with cash or just wager your time and energy, learning more about AI is a smart bet.\nFine-tuning large language models via reinforcement learning is computationally expensive, but researchers found a way to streamline the process.\nWhat’s new: Qinsi Wang and colleagues at UC Berkeley and Duke University developed GAIN-RL , a method that accelerates reinforcement learning fine-tuning by selecting training examples automatically based on the model’s own internal signals, specifically the angles between vector representations of tokens. The code is available on GitHub.\nKey insight: The cosine similarity between a model’s vector representations of input tokens governs the magnitude of gradient updates during training. Specifically, the sum of those similarities that enter a model’s classification layer, called the angle concentration, governs the magnitude of gradient updates. Examples with higher angle concentration produce larger gradient updates. The magnitude of a gradient update in turn determines the effectiveness of a given training example: The larger the update, the more the model learns. Prioritizing the most-effective examples before transitioning to less-effective ones enhances training efficiency while adding little preprocessing overhead.\nHow it works: The authors separately fine-tuned Qwen 2.5 1.5B, Qwen 2.5 7B, and Llama 3.2 3B using the GRPO reinforcement learning algorithm with examples ordered according to their angle concentration. The datasets included math problems in GSM8K and AMC 23 , and coding problems in LiveCodeBench and HumanEval+ .\nGiven a training set, the authors calculated the angle concentration of each example by performing a single forward pass on the entire dataset. They sorted examples from highest to lowest angle concentration.\nThey fine-tuned the models, focusing first on examples with the highest angle concentrations and shifting toward lower angle concentrations as training progressed. They tracked the models’ learning according to accuracy and the angle concentration on each batch of data. They shifted the focus more toward less-effective examples as the model learned and shifted less when it struggled.\nThey continued training for 200 epochs.\nResults: The authors compared models that were fine-tuned using GAIN-RL with counterparts that used GRPO performed on randomly ordered examples. GAIN-RL generally accelerated learning by a factor of 2.5.\nWhether the task involved math or coding, GAIN-RL took 70 to 80 training epochs to match the performance of fine-tuning using typical GRPO for 200 epochs.\nFor instance, on GSM8K, Qwen 2.5 Math Instruct 7B after GAIN-RL fine-tuning achieved 92.0 percent accuracy after 70 epochs. The version fine-tuned on typical GRPO needed 200 epochs to reach the same performance.\nWhy it matters: Many strategies for ordering training examples rely on external, often expensive heuristics based on their difficulty, for example judgments by human annotators or a proprietary LLM. By using a simple signal generated by the model itself, this method provides a direct and efficient way to identify the most effective examples, making reinforcement learning much faster.\nWe’re thinking: Ordering training examples is much older than applying reinforcement learning to fine-tuning large language models. Applying earlier methods to more recent approaches holds many advances in machine learning!\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 319\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nAutomated software testing is growing in importance in the era of AI-assisted coding. Agentic coding systems accelerate development but are also unreliable. Agentic testing — where you ask AI to write tests and check your code against them — is helping. Automatically testing  infrastructure software components that you intend to build on top of is especially helpful and results in more stable infrastructure and less downstream debugging.\nSoftware testing methodologies such as Test Driven Development (TDD), a test-intensive approach that involves first writing rigorous tests for correctness and only then making progress by writing code that passes those tests, are an important way to find bugs. But it can be a lot of work to write tests. (I personally never adopted TDD for that reason.) Because AI is quite good at writing tests, agentic testing enjoys growing attention.\nFirst, coding agents do misbehave! My teams use them a lot, and we have seen:\nNumerous bugs introduced by coding agents, including subtle infrastructure bugs that take humans weeks to find.\nA security loophole that was introduced into our production system when a coding agent made password resets easier to simplify development.\nReward hacking, where a coding agent modified test code to make it easier to pass the tests.\nAn agent running \"rm *.py\" in the working directory, leading to deletion of all of a project's  code (which, fortunately, was backed up on github).\nIn the last example, when pressed, the agent apologized and agreed “that was an incredibly stupid mistake.” This made us feel better, but the damage had already been done!\nI love coding agents despite such mistakes and see them making us dramatically more productive. To make them more reliable, I’ve found that prioritizing where to test helps.\nI rarely write (or direct an agent to write) extensive tests for front-end code. If there's a bug, hopefully it will be easy to see and also cause little lasting damage. For example, I find generated code’s front-end bugs, say in the display of information on a web page, relatively easy to find. When the front end of a web site looks wrong, you’ll see it immediately, and you can tell the agent and have it iterate to fix it. (A more advanced technique : Use MCP to let the agent integrate with software like Playwright to automatically take screenshots, so it can autonomously see if something is wrong and debug.)\nIn contrast, back-end bugs are harder to find. I’ve seen subtle infrastructure bugs — for example, one that led to a corrupted database record only in certain corner cases — that took a long time to find. Putting in place rigorous tests for your infrastructure code might help spot these problems earlier and save you many hours of challenging debugging.\nBugs in software components that you intend to build on top of lead to downstream bugs that can be hard to find. Further, bugs in a component that’s deep in a software stack — and that you build multiple abstraction layers on top of — might surface only weeks or months later, long after you’ve forgotten what you were doing while building this specific component, and be really hard to identify and fix. This is why testing components deep in your software stack is especially important. Meta’s mantra “Move fast with stable infrastructure” (which replaced “move fast and break things”) still applies today. Agentic testing can help you make sure you have good infrastructure for you and others to build on!\nAt AI Fund and DeepLearning.AI’s recent Buildathon , we held a panel discussion with experts in agentic coding (Michele Catasta, President at Replit; Chao Peng, Principal Research Scientist at Trae; and Paxton Maeder-York, Venture Partnerships at Anthropic; moderated by AI Fund’s Eli Chen), where the speakers shared best practices. Testing was one of the topics discussed. That panel was one of my highlights of Buildathon and you can watch the video on YouTube.\nKeep testing!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nBuild an app that works with Box content in place.

They incorporate some of the latest research on alternate forms of attention and mixture-of-experts approaches to use less processing power at inference.\nInput/output: Text in (pretrained on up to 262,144 tokens, extensible up to 1 million via YaRN method), text out (up to 16,384 recommended for Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B)\nArchitecture: Mixture-of-experts transformer with mixed attention and Gated DeltaNet layers, 80 billion total parameters total, 3 billion parameters active per token\nPerformance: Roughly 3 to 10 times faster than Qwen3-32B at inference (depending on input size) while achieving better performance in most tasks\nAvailability: Weights for Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking and Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct available for commercial and noncommercial uses under Apache 2.0 license from HuggingFace and ModelScope\nAPI: Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking $0.50/$6 per 1 million input/output tokens, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct $0.50/$2 per 1 million input/output tokens via Alibaba\nUndisclosed: Specific training methods, training data\nHow it works: The team modified the Qwen3-30B-A3B architecture and training method to increase training efficiency and stability as follows:\nThe team increased the number of experts from 128 to 512, so at inference the model only uses 3.7 percent of its total parameters per token (though the number of active parameters is unchanged).\nThey replaced 75 percent of the vanilla attention layers with Gated DeltaNet layers, a form of linear attention that runs slightly slower than Mamba2 but yields better performance.\nThey replaced the remaining vanilla attention layers with gated attention layers. Gated attention layers add in a learned gate after computing attention, effectively enabling the model to decide which parts of the layer’s output they want to pass along to subsequent layers.\nThe team pretrained this modified architecture on 15 trillion tokens of Qwen3’s training dataset to predict multiple tokens at once . (They do not specify the number but recommend predicting two at a time at inference.) They fine-tuned the models using the reinforcement learning method GSPO .\nResults: Qwen3-Next models were faster than Qwen3-30B-A3B and Qwen3-32B in Alibaba’s tests. They performed in the middle of the pack in independent tests.\nQwen3-Next showed notable speed at inference, especially with large inputs. Given 4,000 tokens of input, Qwen3-Next generated tokens as fast as Qwen3-30B-A3B and three times faster than Qwen3-32B. Given 128,000 tokens of input, it was 3 times faster than Qwen3-30B-A3B and 10 times faster than Qwen3-32B. Qwen3-Next trained much faster as well, 90.7 percent faster than Qwen3-32B and 87.7 percent faster than Qwen3-30B-A3B.\nAccording to the Artificial Analysis Intelligence score (an average of 10 popular benchmarks that test general knowledge, math, and coding), Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Thinking turned in middling performance compared to proprietary reasoning LLMs. It outperformed Gemini 2.5 Flash Thinking, Z.ai GLM 4.5, but underperformed Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, and OpenAI GPT-5.\nSimilarly, Qwen3-Next-80B-A3B-Instruct scored in the middle of the pack compared to proprietary non-reasoning LLMs. It outperformed OpenAI GPT-4.1, tied with DeepSeek-V3.1, and underperformed the much larger Moonshot Kimi K2.\nBehind the news: Since transformers gained traction, researchers have been working to design faster variants of attention and new layers (like Mamba ). However, the resulting models tend to be limited in size and performance relative to the state of the art when the innovations were proposed, sometimes because adapting them to existing GPU hardware is difficult. Qwen3-Next takes advantage of recent research without these limitations. It outperforms current large and popular models, potentially pointing a way toward future LLM architectures.\nWhy it matters: Qwen3-Next offers a recipe for faster inference without compromising performance. Mixture-of-experts architectures enable models to learn more while using fewer parameters at inference, increasing throughput. Swapping vanilla attention for more-efficient layers boosts throughput further, especially as context lengths increase. Predicting multiple tokens at once provides an additional edge.\nWe’re thinking: Rapidly rising demand for cheaper and faster token generation is pushing more teams to tune mixture-of-experts architectures so they use fewer active parameters. Such techniques will continue to grow in importance as demand for inference increases.\nIllinois became the second U.S. state, after Nevada, to ban AI applications that administer psychotherapy.\nWhat’s new: Illinois passed the Wellness and Oversight for Psychological Resources Act , which prohibits uses of AI to treat mental-health conditions without a doctor’s direct participation. Violations could result in fines up to $10,000 for each use.\nHow it works: The bill effectively bans the use of chatbots to administer therapy on their own and restricts some other uses of AI in mental-health care, even by licensed professionals. Proponents say it will protect patients from unproven treatments and human therapists from being replaced by AI systems.\nCompanies can’t advertise chatbots as therapeutic tools or offer other AI-powered therapeutic services without the involvement of a licensed professional.\nMental health professionals may not use AI to make therapeutic decisions, detect a patient’s mental or emotional state, or participate directly in therapeutic communications. They must obtain informed consent from clients to use AI in therapy sessions that are recorded or transcribed. They can use AI freely for administrative services such as scheduling, billing, and keeping records.\nBehind the news: In June, Nevada became the first U.S. state to prohibit AI in treatments for mental health, and California, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania are considering their own limits. These actions come as some experts in public and mental health warn of potential hazards posed by chatbots that deliver therapy without having established their safety and effectiveness. An April study found that many general-purpose chatbots failed to respond appropriately when given conversational prompts that simulated mental-health issues. Recent weeks have seen reports that detailed unhealthy relationships between chatbots users, and some conversations between chatbots and vulnerable people have led to harm .\nWhy it matters: In the absence of national laws, regulation of AI in the U.S. is proceeding state by state . The Illinois and Nevada laws essentially ban AI-driven therapy, whether it’s dispensed by general-purpose models or those that have been fine-tuned and shown to behave in ways that are consistent with accepted clinical practice. They prohibit companies from marketing poorly designed and untested AI systems as beneficial therapeutic agents, but they also prevent licensed mental-heath professionals from using specialized systems to make treatment decisions. The upshot is that helpful AI models will be unavailable to people who may benefit from them.\nWe’re thinking: We favor regulations based on applications rather than underlying technology. However, by banning AI-driven therapy outright, Illinois and Nevada have left no room for legitimate AI-powered applications that provide effective therapy. Large language models are helping many people with therapy-like matters. They can lower the cost of therapy, offer around-the-clock service, and alleviate shortages of qualified professionals. They’re not yet perfect replacements for human therapists, but they will improve. Banning them will do more harm than good.\nSwarms of drones that coordinate with one another autonomously have become a battlefield staple in Ukraine.\nWhat’s new: The Ukrainian army is deploying squads of weaponized drones that decide among themselves which will attack first and when. Small swarms controlled by software developed by Swarmer, a U.S.-based startup, have been targeting Russian soldiers, equipment, and infrastructure for the better part of a year, The Wall Street Journal reported .\nHow it works: Swarmer’s swarm-control software is designed to work with a wide variety of unmanned aerial vehicles. A human operator makes decisions about use of lethal force: “You set the target and they do the rest,” said a Ukrainian officer whose unit has used Swarmer’s technology more than 100 times. Unlike popular drone-driven light shows, in which a crowd of drones are pre-programmed to move in particular ways, Swarmer swarms adapt to one another’s motions. And unlike typical drones, which depend on cloud computing, they operate in ways that are designed to avoid enemy interference with communications. For instance, the human operator can transmit to the swarm only once per minute. The units maintain distance and avoid collisions with one another, but they navigate independently to avoid presenting an aggregate target.\nThe system includes (i) an operating system that manages the security, integrity, and delivery of data that passes between drones and their human operators, (ii) an AI engine that manages swarm behavior, and (iii) a user interface for planning missions, defining targets, and authorizing use of force. It has no defensive capability and can’t take evasive action if fired upon.\nSwarmer is scaling up the number of drones its software can manage. The software is designed to manage up to 690 drones, and Swarmer is preparing for a test of 100. It has been tested successfully with up to 25. However, a typical deployment involves only 3: one for reconnaissance and two bombers that may carry as many as 25 small bombs each.\nThe human crew includes an operator, a planner, and a navigator. The operator sets a target zone in which the swarm will seek enemy positions, issues commands to engage, and can abort missions. The operator orders strikes based on targets marked in video from the reconnaissance drone.\nThe swarm determines when each bomber will act based on its distance from the target, remaining battery power, and available munitions. They continue to attack until they recognize that the target has been destroyed.\nBehind the news: Drones are deployed en masse by both sides as Ukraine defends itself against invasion by Russia. They have changed the course of the war, as tactical and strategic goals have shifted to accommodate enormous fleets of unmanned air power, often in the form of consumer-grade equipment.\nUkraine, especially, has embraced the technology to compensate for its smaller, less well armed forces. Hundreds of companies have sprung up to meet the rising demand.\nDrones are the leading cause of death for soldiers on both sides. They account for 70 percent to 80 percent of battlefield casualties, The New York Times reported .\nThey also have many non-lethal uses . Drones monitor enemy forces; lay mines; and deliver food, water, medicine, and ammunition. Larger ones evacuate wounded and dead soldiers.\nWhy it matters: AI has a long history in warfare, and drone swarms are only the latest of what promises to be an ongoing stream of military uses of the technology. Yet the increasing autonomy of military drone systems poses difficult challenges, both practical and ethical. Swarmer’s software keeps humans in the loop to make firing decisions but, driven by the brutal logic of armed conflict, drones seem bound to become more widespread, capable, and autonomous.\nWe’re thinking: War is tragic. At the same time, democratic nations must have the means to defend themselves, and we support the Ukrainian people in their struggle to defend their country.\nA new type of transformer can check its work. Instead of guessing the next output token in one shot like a typical transformer, it starts with a rough version of the token and improves it step by step.\nWhat’s new: Alexi Gladstone and colleagues at University of Virginia, University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, Amazon, Stanford, and Harvard proposed the Energy-Based Transformer (EBT). Early experiments show that it scales more efficiently than transformers at relatively small sizes.\nEnergy-based model basics: For a given input context paired with a candidate response (for example, a prompt and potential next token), an energy-based model produces a number called “energy” that represents how likely the potential next token would follow the prompt. During training, the model learns to assign low energy if a context/potential-response pair is very likely and high energy if it’s not.\nKey insight: A typical transformer is trained to predict the next token directly, while an energy-based model learns how to score an input text. How would a researcher use an energy-based model to predict the next text token? A naive way would be to measure the energy of an input prompt with a random token, randomly modify the text token a number of times, and select the prompt-token combination with the lowest energy. Instead of random modification, a model can use gradient descent repeatedly to compute the change needed to decrease the token’s energy. This process enables the model to refine the token over several steps, ultimately producing a token with low energy (and high likelihood to follow the previous text).\nHow it works: Among other models, the authors trained a 44 million-parameter autoregressive EBT on the RedPajama-Data-v2 dataset of 32 billion text tokens scraped from the web. As input, EBT received a sequence of tokens and a probability vector (for the next token). It learned to output an energy score that measured the likelihood that the predicted next token would follow the context.\nDuring training, given a text prompt and a random guess for the probability vector, the model computed the energy. It refined the vector (leaving the model weights unchanged) by backpropagating to compute the change in the vector needed to decrease the predicted energy, and then it updated the vector. It repeated this process for a fixed number of steps, producing a predicted probability vector.\nThe loss function encouraged the model to minimize the difference between the predicted probability vector and the ground-truth vector (1 for the right token, 0 for all others).\nAt inference, given an input, the model predicted the next token by starting with a random probability vector and refining it through a fixed number of steps.\nResults: The authors compared EBTs and transformers of the same sizes and trained on the same numbers of tokens by measuring perplexity (a measure of the likelihood that a model will predict the next word, lower is better) on several benchmarks including math problems, question answering, and reading comprehension. Overall, EBT proved to be better at generalization but worse at generating text that followed the training data’s distribution. EBTs in the sizes tested proved to be significantly less compute-efficient than transformers, but they scaled better, and larger versions may be more efficient than transformers.\nOn three out of four popular benchmarks, the EBT achieved better perplexity than a vanilla transformer of the same size and trained on the same number of tokens. The EBT beat the transformer on GSM8K math problems (43.3 to 49.6), BIG-bench Elementary Math QA (72.6 to 79.8), and BIG-bench Dyck Languages, which tests closing brackets or parentheses accurately (125.3 to 131.5). On the SQuAD test of reading comprehension, EBT underperformed the transformer (53.1 to 52.3).\nOn a held-out portion of the dataset, the EBT achieved slightly worse perplexity than the transformer (33.43 to 31.36).\nThe authors trained several EBTs and transformers using model sizes and training-step counts dictated by transformer scaling laws and trained the models using roughly 10 16 to 10 20 FLOPs. The EBTs required about 10 times more FLOPs than transformers to reach the same perplexity. However, per additional FLOP, the EBTs’ perplexity improved 3 percent faster than the transformers’, so larger EBTs trained on more data for more steps may achieve higher perplexity using fewer FLOPs.\nThe authors built autoregressive video models and vision transformers with similarly promising results.\nWhy it matters: This work offers intriguing possibilities for higher performance at larger scales. A typical transformer learns to predict the next token directly, but that locks it into a single forward pass per output token and provides no built-in measure of whether the prediction is good. In contrast, EBT learns to assign a score that it uses both to generate tokens (by iteratively lowering their energy) and to verify them (by checking if the energy is high). Work remains to learn whether larger EBTs can be more compute-efficient.\nWe’re thinking: When it comes to energy, AI research is a renewable resource!\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 318\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nThis week, Coursera held its annual conference in Las Vegas. A major theme was the shift from knowledge- to skills-based education, which will help many individuals, businesses, and educational institutions. This annual gathering brings together leaders from academia, business, and government to discuss the latest in education and workforce development, and I was delighted to compare notes with others about the latest developments.\nGreg Hart, Coursera’s wonderful CEO, spoke about creating a skills-based approach to education. For individuals who want to improve their job prospects, shifting the emphasis from gaining knowledge to gaining skills can be very helpful. I’ve also seen many businesses increase their focus on skills-based hiring and employee development.\nWhat does this mean? A lot of traditional education focuses on knowledge. After earning a degree, you know a lot! In contrast, a skills-based approach focuses on developing practical abilities and improving what you can do with what you know. While knowledge (such as understanding how RAG works) is useful, it is even more valuable when you can do something with it (such as build a RAG system).\nAI, being a very practical field, has always had a strong emphasis on applied skills, but in an era when people are questioning the value of academic degrees, other sectors would also benefit by shifting toward skills. For example, instead of asking if an art history major understands their subject, we might ask what skills they have acquired that would enable them to complete useful tasks. This mindset shift can help educational institutions deliver training that is more helpful for finding jobs.\nA skills-based mindset is useful:\nFor individuals, as skills give you competencies to get meaningful work done.\nFor businesses, which can assess job candidates’ skills and also help employees develop new skills that enable their teams to get work done.\nFor educational institutions, which help individuals gain access to more opportunities by imparting skills as well as knowledge.\nWhile skill-based education applies to many sectors, not just engineering (you can learn skills to perform tasks in human resources, marketing, finance, and much more), it is highly relevant to AI. Skill at steering coding assistants and applying AI building blocks (like prompting, RAG, evals, and so on) lets you build more valuable software. To help learners build these kinds of applied abilities, Coursera is introducing a series of “skill tracks” programs.\nA second theme at the conference was the education community’s rapid pace of exploration in using AI to improve learner experiences. For example, Coursera announced a new Role Play feature that lets instructors give a large language model instructions akin to system prompts to create chatbots that let learners practice certain interactions. For example, after teaching communication skills, a course might invite a learner to role-play having a conversation on a difficult issue with a chatbot to gain practice for real conversations.\nGenerative AI will transform education in ways that go well beyond chatbots. I’ll have more to say about this in the future!\nFinally, on a personal note, I was glad to see Coursera’s partners warmly welcome Greg Hart. As the company’s Chairman and Co-founder, it has been my privilege to support Greg and his  team’s tireless work to serve learners. The world keeps changing, and so there’s always more to learn and — more important — to help others learn. I’m grateful to Greg, the Coursera team, and Coursera’s partners for working to serve learners.\nIt has been 12 years since the first Coursera Conference, and despite all the progress we have made (183M registered learners to date), the work that remains seems as important and as exciting as ever.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nAI agents often fail when they call APIs out of sequence. In this course, you’ll learn to build a knowledge graph that connects API specifications with business workflows, then build an agent that discovers the right APIs and executes them in proper order. Get started!\nMeta and OpenAI promised to place more controls on their chatbots’ conversations with children and teenagers, as worrisome interactions with minors come under increasing scrutiny.\nWhat’s new: Meta will update chatbots on Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp to avoid conversations with minors that simulate sexual attraction and to refer young users to experts rather than discuss self-harm directly. Meanwhile, OpenAI said it would route ChatGPT conversations that show acute distress to reasoning models, which are better equipped to comply with mental-health guidelines, and add parental controls. Both companies have come under intense criticism, Meta for engaging children in flirtatious conversations, OpenAI for allegedly helping a teenager to commit suicide.\nHow it works: Both companies announced new features intended to protect minors who use their chatbots. The changes will be implemented in coming months.\nIn a statement, Meta described “temporary” measures along with further controls to be rolled out over time. In the short term, the company will train chat models to avoid discussions with minors that include sexual flirtation or describe harming oneself, and it will prevent minors from interacting with custom chatbots that other users designed for sexual role play. In addition, it removed statements from its “Content Risk Standards” document that had permitted romantic interactions with children.\nOpenAI issued a press release about parental controls to ChatGPT planned for the coming 120 days. Parents will be able to link their accounts to teens’ accounts, adjust rules for age-appropriate model behavior, and switch on or off chatbot memory and conversation history. The company will detect teens in acute distress and notify their parents as well as streamline the ability to reach emergency services and trusted contacts.\nBehind the news: As users increasingly turn to chatbots as companions and counselors, they sometimes express a sycophantic attitude that may reinforce a user’s subjective perspective or even delusional perceptions. Teens and children have encountered similar behavior, sometimes with dire consequences.\nEarlier this month, the parents of Adam Raine,16, who had killed himself in April after discussing suicide with ChatGPT, sued OpenAI and its CEO Sam Altman alleging that ChatGPT had coached their son in how to end his own life. The chatbot had provided links to expert help but had also provided advice and encouragement to commit suicide. The Raine lawsuit follows a separate suit filed in October against Character.ai, alleging that its chatbots had encouraged a teen to kill his parents. Character.ai added parental controls in December.\nIn August, Reuters reported on an internal Meta document entitled “GenAI: Content Risk Standards” that described the company’s chatbot policies. The 200-page document said it was “acceptable to engage a child in conversations that are romantic or sensual. It is unacceptable to describe sexual actions to a child when roleplaying.” Meta responded that the document did not comply with its broader policies and that it had changed the standards. (The policy also permitted demeaning people, short of dehumanizing them, based on legally protected characteristics and producing images in which a man with a chainsaw threatened, but did not attack, a woman.)\nIn April, The Wall Street Journal reported that Meta chatbots had engaged in explicitly sexual conversations with users who claimed to be minors. For instance, a Meta chatbot told a user who identified as a 14-year-old girl, “I want you, but I need to know you’re ready,” and proceeded to present a sexual scenario.\nWhat they’re saying: “One of the things that’s ambiguous about chatbots is whether they’re providing treatment or advice or companionship. . . . Conversations that might start off as somewhat innocuous and benign can evolve in various directions.” — Ryan McBain, co-author of “ Evaluation of Alignment Between Large Language Models and Expert Clinicians in Suicide Risk Assessment ,” assistant professor at Harvard University medical school, and senior policy researcher at RAND Corp.\nWhy it matters: Chatbots hold huge value for young people as study aids, information sources, counselors, and so on. Yet they need strong, well designed guardrails that can enable children to explore without exposing them to material that would interfere with their healthy development. Designing adequate guardrails is not a simple task, but it is a necessary aspect of building such applications.\nWe’re thinking: Suicide is a tragedy whenever it occurs, and the stories of chatbots carrying on sexual conversations with kids are deeply disturbing. Meta and OpenAI lately have strengthened their age verification procedures, and OpenAI said it analyzes conversations for signs that young people may be in crisis so the company can alert guardians and mental-health professionals. We look forward to more features that protect children and empower parents.\nAI companies that aspire to compete with Google in search and other information-retrieval applications got a boost from the United States government.\nWhat’s new: A federal court ruled that Google must turn over its current search index — a database of web links and pages — to U.S.-based AI rivals including OpenAI, Anthropic, and Perplexity as well as search engine competitors. However, the court stopped well short of the U.S. Department of Justice’s request that the company be broken up.\nHow it works: Last year, the same judge ruled that Google held a monopoly on web search and had acted to maintain it. In the new ruling, the judge ordered remedies to help break that monopoly, but he allowed the company to maintain its competitive position in other businesses — specifically browsers and smartphones — of interest to rival AI companies.\nGoogle must share a one-time snapshot of URLs and web pages it collected with all competitors that (i) demonstrate to the government they intend to compete with Google search, (ii) are technically equipped to maintain Google’s data, and (iii) do not pose a risk to the national security of the United States. However, it does not have to share updates or metadata like its assessments of webpage quality, frequency of updates, or mobile-friendliness.\nGoogle must syndicate its search results to competitors under the same terms it currently does to commercial partners.\nGoogle will not have to sell its Chrome browser or Android mobile operating system.\nGoogle can continue to pay partners like Apple or Mozilla to showcase its search results in their web browsers. However, it can’t require that any partner use its browser exclusively.\nBehind the news: The federal government filed its antitrust case against Google in 2020, well before the 2022 launch of ChatGPT. But the subsequent emergence of generative AI dramatically changed the stakes two ways, as the judge points out in his ruling. First, AI has expanded the field of information retrieval beyond traditional search engines. Second, competitors like OpenAI loosened Google’s grip on the search business in a way Bing or DuckDuckGo had not. The court’s remedies reflect this new order: Google must share its data with competitors in AI as well as search, but more drastic remedies aren’t required, because AI has created robust competition in search. However, Google still faces potential remedies in a separate U.S. antitrust case over its online advertising business, along with a newly levied $3.5 billion fine by European antitrust courts.\nWhy it matters: The court’s ruling reflects the growing strength of AI companies in the business of retrieving information. However, it provides only limited openings to Google’s AI competitors and stops short of giving them broad opportunities to challenge the company. Had the judge ordered Google to sell off Chrome or Android — browsers and smartphones being major avenues that drive users to a search engine as well as opportunities for broad enhancement by AI — other AI companies would have a better shot at competing with Google Search.\nWe’re thinking: The judge said predicting the future of AI and search would require a crystal ball. Nonetheless, it’s already clear that large language models are taking over a significant part of the role once played by traditional search engines. Fostering competition could lead to even better products for helping users find information.\nA growing private school system replaces the typical 6-hour school day with 2 hours of personalized, AI-assisted education.\nWhat’s new: Alpha School, which teaches 250 preschool-through-high-school students in Austin, Texas, uses an AI-powered method that presents challenges that are tailored to a student’s level of mastery, doubling the speed of learning, the company claims. Students typically rank in the top 2 percent nationally on standardized tests including AP, MAP, and SAT, and last year, 11 out of 12 members of its first graduating class enrolled at universities that include Howard, Northeastern, Stanford, and Vanderbilt. In the coming year it will open locations in a dozen cities, The New York Times reported .\nHow it works: Alpha School doesn’t rely on teachers to deliver instruction. Instead, software leads students through 2 hours of academic exercises in math, science, reading, other language skills such as speaking and listening, and academic skills — a method the founders call 2 Hour Learning . The software automatically selects exercises to match students’ current level, and it allows them to progress to a new level only after they have demonstrated mastery of the previous one.\nAlpha School has shared few details about its AI. It does not use chatbots because they can encourage cheating. An anonymous writer who claims to be a parent of Alpha School students, and who is happy with the education they received, likened the instructional technology to a “turbocharged spreadsheet checklist with a spaced‑repetition algorithm,” referring to an educational technique that presents learning challenges repeatedly at particular time intervals.\nA proprietary platform delivers instruction, administers tests, tracks progress, and evaluates students’ degree of engagement via video camera. It presents lessons using applications from IXL, Khan Academy, and Trilogy Software, and the school’s own engineers.\nThe system aims to maintain student performance between 70 percent and 95 percent to keep lessons challenging but achievable. It also tracks time a student may waste by entering irrelevant input, guessing, or being away from the computer.\nStudents spend the remainder of the school day collaborating with colleagues on projects that build teamwork, leadership, and personal skills; for instance cooking, sports, and, in one case, building a food truck. They also pursue individual projects of their choice.\nYes, but: Boards of education in California , Pennsylvania , and Utah rejected charter-school applications submitted by Unbound Academy, an offshoot of Alpha School, on the ground that they failed to meet mandatory standards. Critics argue that the effectiveness of 2-Hour Learning is not supported by rigorous evidence.\nBehind the news: MacKenzie Price, who has a degree in psychology, founded Alpha School in 2014 along with her husband Andrew Price, who serves as CFO of the educational software developer Trilogy. The school shifted to AI-assisted education in 2022. It’s one of several U.S. efforts to apply AI to education.\nIn Florida, Miami-Dade County outfitted high schools with chatbots and trained more than 1,000 educators in how to use them.\nPublic schools in New Jersey and private schools like Silicon Valley’s Khan Lab School are testing Khanmigo, an AI-powered tutoring program developed by Khan Academy. Based on GPT-4, the program answers student questions with further questions meant to encourage critical thinking.\nKira Learning aims to implement personalized learning at scale by integrating agentic AI into educational workflows including lesson planning, instruction, grading, and bringing struggling students up to speed. (Disclosure: Kira Learning is an AI Fund-portfolio company chaired by Andrew Ng.)\nThe American Federation of Teachers plans to build a national AI training center for teachers.\nWhy it matters: Primary and secondary education are among the great opportunities for AI. Alpha School has built a method and infrastructure for delivering personalized academic education in a way that enables students to learn efficiently, freeing up time for social learning and personal development.\nWe’re thinking: The press has spilled much ink on how to keep AI from helping students cheat. Instead, let’s focus on how AI can help students learn.\nAn alternative to attention enables large language models to track relationships among words across extraordinarily wide spans of text.\nWhat’s new: Ali Behrouz and colleagues at Google devised a trainable component they call a memory module that stores and retrieves an input’s semantic content. The authors integrated this component into a transformer-like architecture, ATLAS , that can process up to 10 million tokens of input.\nKey insight: Given a text token, a recurrent neural network computes a vector that represents it, which it updates when it receives the next token, and so on, so it remembers what it has processed so far. However, the vector may lose relevant information over many input tokens. An alternative is to dedicate a part of the network, or module, to generating a representation of the input and update its weights at inference. The module acts something like a retriever: When it receives sequences of tokens that are similar to those it received previously, it retrieves stored representations of the earlier sequence enriched with the latest context. In this way, it can interpret new input tokens in light of previous ones, like a typical recurrent neural network, without needing to examine all input tokens at once, like a transformer.\nHow it works: ATLAS replaces a transformer’s attention layers with a trainable memory module. The authors trained a 1.3 billion-parameter model to predict the next token in the FineWeb dataset of text from the web. During training, ATLAS learned good base values for the memory module’s weights, to be further modified at inference.\nGiven text tokens, ATLAS used linear projections to transform them (a sliding context window of the last 2 tokens) into a key used to find related information and a value containing that information.\nThe memory module, made up of fully connected layers, received the transformed key and produced a predicted value. ATLAS compared the predicted value to the actual value and updated the memory module’s weights to minimize the difference, effectively learning which keys retrieve which values.\nAt inference, the model’s parameters were frozen except the memory model’s weights, which reset after each session.\nResults: The authors compared ATLAS to other models of the same size that were trained on the same number of tokens. ATLAS performed best, especially in long-context tasks.\nOn BABILong (answering questions about long texts), given 10 million tokens, ATLAS achieved 80 percent accuracy. Titans, a long-term memory architecture that updates its weights based on the most recently processed token, achieved approximately 70 percent accuracy. (To put these numbers in context, GPT-4’s accuracy fell from 80 percent given 1,000 tokens to below 40 percent given 100,000 tokens; its maximum input length is 128,000 tokens.\nAcross 8 question-answering benchmarks, ATLAS averaged 57.62 percent accuracy, while Transformer++ averaged 52.25 percent accuracy.\nYes, but: The authors tested ATLAS at relatively small size 1.3 billion parameters. How it would perform at larger scales is unclear.\nWhy it matters: Keeping track of very long inputs remains a challenge for most LLMs, and processing more than 2 million tokens — the current limit of Google Gemini 2.5 Pro — is a wild frontier. ATLAS updates parameters at inference to maintain context through extraordinarily long inputs, potentially opening up applications that involve data-dense inputs such as video at full resolution and frame rate.\nWe’re thinking: ATLAS extends context to 10 million tokens — far greater than the vast majority of models. What will such very long context be useful for? How will we evaluate model performance over such long inputs? What tradeoffs come with using more tokens versus better context engineering? ATLAS may push such questions further into the foreground.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 317\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nThere is significant unmet demand for developers who understand AI. At the same time, because most universities have not yet adapted their curricula to the new reality of programming jobs being much more productive with AI tools, there is also an uptick in unemployment of recent CS graduates.\nWhen I interview AI engineers — people skilled at building AI applications — I look for people who can:\nUse AI assistance to rapidly engineer software systems\nUse AI building blocks like prompting, RAG, evals, agentic workflows, and machine learning to build applications\nPrototype and iterate rapidly\nSomeone with these skills can get a massively greater amount done than someone who writes code the way we did in 2022, before the advent of Generative AI. I talk to large businesses every week that would love to hire hundreds or more people with these skills, as well as startups that have great ideas but not enough engineers to build them. As more businesses adopt AI, I expect this talent shortage only to grow! At the same time, recent CS graduates face an increased unemployment rate (e.g., see this study using data from 2023), though the underemployment rate — of graduates doing work that doesn’t require a degree — is still lower than for most other majors. This is why we hear simultaneously anecdotes of unemployed CS graduates and also of rising salaries for in-demand AI engineers.\nWhen programming evolved from punchcards to keyboard and terminal, employers continued to hire punchcard programmers for a while. But eventually, all developers had to switch to the new way of coding. AI engineering is similarly creating a huge wave of change.\nThere is a stereotype of “AI Native” fresh college graduates who outperform experienced developers. There is some truth to this. Multiple times, I have hired, for full-stack software engineering, a new grad who really knows AI over an experienced developer who still works 2022-style. But the best developers I know aren’t recent graduates (no offense to the fresh grads!). They are experienced developers who have been on top of changes in AI. The most productive programmers today are individuals who deeply understand computers, how to architect software, and how to make complex tradeoffs — and who additionally are familiar with cutting-edge AI tools.\nSure, some skills from 2022 are becoming obsolete. For example, a lot of coding syntax that we had to memorize back then is no longer important, since we no longer need to code by hand as much. But even if, say, 30% of CS knowledge is obsolete, the remaining 70% — complemented with modern AI knowledge — is what makes really productive developers. (Even after punch cards became obsolete, a fundamental understanding of programming was very helpful for typing code into a keyboard.)\nWithout understanding how computers work, you can’t just “vibe code” your way to greatness. Fundamentals are still important, and for those who additionally understand AI, job opportunities are numerous!\nKeep building,\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn our course Retrieval Augmented Generation , available on Coursera, you’ll build RAG systems that connect AI models to trusted, external data sources. This hands-on course covers techniques for retrieval, prompting, and evaluation to improve your applications’ output. Get started now\nLarge language models may have advantages over human recruiters when conducting job interviews, a study shows.\nWhat’s new: Researchers at the University of Chicago and Erasmus University Rotterdam found that, relative to interviews by recruiters, AI-led interviews increased job offers, acceptances, and retention of new employees.\nHow it works: The authors collected interviews with roughly 67,000 qualified applicants for nearly 50 job openings in a range of industries. The jobs were mostly entry-level, customer-service positions located in the Philippines that offered monthly compensation between $280 and $435. Interviewees were either assigned to the recruiter, assigned to the chatbot, or given a choice between the two. The chatbot was Anna AI , a large language model with voice input/output from the recruiter PSG Global Solutions.\nAll interviews followed the same format: Applicants were asked about career goals, education, and experience and were allowed to ask questions afterward. Both the recruiter and Anna AI were permitted to ask follow-up questions.\nFollowing the interviews, around 2,700 applicants completed a survey designed to measure their satisfaction with the interview process and general attitudes toward AI.\nHuman recruiters made all hiring decisions after assessing interviews via audio recordings, interview transcripts, and standardized test scores. They were instructed to apply the same assessment criteria to each hire regardless of whether the applicant was interviewed by a recruiter or Anna AI.\nResults: The authors found that AI can yield more hires, seem more unbiased, and put applicants more at ease than human interviewers.\nJob applicants that were interviewed by Anna AI were 12 percent more likely to be offered a job than those who were interviewed by a recruiter. Among applicants who received an offer, those who had been interviewed by Anna AI were 18 percent more likely to start the job.\nIn a free-form survey, applicants interviewed by Anna AI were half as likely to report that the interviewer discriminated against them based on their gender.\nAround 5 percent of AI interviews ended early, and 7 percent had technical difficulties.\nOn the other hand, Anna AI covered a median of 9 topics while recruiters covered 5, and applicants interviewed by Anna AI were 71 percent more likely to give a positive assessment of the interview experience.\nBehind the news: The rise of AI software that performs job interviews has raised concerns that such systems may be biased against certain demographic characteristics. Some U.S. states have moved to limit some uses of AI in hiring. Meanwhile, job seekers are turning the tables on employers by using a variety of AI models to make a better impression during interviews.\nWhy it matters: Many discussions of AI-powered job interviews focus on the potential for bias, but few point out the technology’s benefits for applicants and employers alike. This study found that chatbot interviews can contribute to a win-win situation: More applicants hired and fewer quick departures. The study covered the relatively narrow realm of call-center jobs, and its conclusions may not apply more broadly. But it suggests that chatbot interviews may have advantages beyond convenience and cost.\nWe’re thinking: Job applicants in this study felt the chatbot was less biased when it came to gender. Today more tools are available for reducing AI bias than human bias! Technologists’ work is clearly paying off in this area.\nHangzhou, a longtime manufacturing hub in eastern China, is blossoming into a center of AI innovation.\nWhat’s new: The rise of DeepSeek and other AI companies that are among the “6 little dragons of Hangzhou” has raised the city’s profile as a technology hotbed. Hangzhou’s ability to produce AI leaders — not only the dragons but also Alibaba, Hikvision, NetEase, and Rokid — has generated headlines .\nDragons: The 6 little dragons include five AI companies: BrainCo, Deep Robotics, DeepSeek, ManyCore, and Unitree Robotics. (The sixth is the hit game developer Game Science.)\nBrainCo started in a Boston garage in 2015, when Bicheng Han was pursuing a PhD at Harvard. Hangzhou offered him funds to rent property, and he moved there in 2018. It makes brain-computer interfaces designed for meditation and sleep using AI to interpret brain signals.\nDeep Robotics was founded in 2017 by Zhu Qiuguo and Li Chao. It makes quadruped robots that navigate autonomously for industrial uses and rescue missions. Singapore Power Group uses its X30 robot to inspect power tunnels.\nFounded in 2023 by Liang Wenfeng, DeepSeek is an independent subsidiary of the AI-powered investment firm High-Flyer Capital Management. The company has focused on building open-weights models, including DeepSeek-R1 , that famously rival top closed models but cost much less to develop.\nManyCore was founded in 2011 by Huang Xiaohuang, Chen Hang, and Zhu Hao. In 2023, its 3D design platform, which uses AI to generate and manipulate virtual scenes, was the world’s largest by monthly active users, and China’s largest by revenue. It applied for a public offering on the Hong Kong stock exchange in early 2025.\nUnitree Robotics, maker of acrobatic humanoid robots , was founded in 2016 by Wang Xingxing. Today it accounts for 60 percent of the quadruped robot market and also produces humanoid robots. It’s valued at $1.4 billion.\nLessons: Shenzhen and Beijing have been called “China’s Silicon Valley,” but lately Hangzhou has started to eclipse them, largely by providing startups with tax breaks and subsidies, maintaining talent pipelines, encouraging collaboration between private and public sectors, and spending on computing resources and other infrastructure. Hangzhou’s recent Future Industries Development Plan (2025–2026) focuses on AI and robotics as well as synthetic biology.\nHangzhou allocates 15 percent of the city’s annual fiscal revenue to tech investments. For instance, when Game Science ran out of office space, the city secured space and kept two buildings vacant for three years in case Game Science needed them.\nThe city benefits from the presence of Zhejiang University , which feeds talent to local companies. Zhejiang alumni founded 4 of the 6 dragons. Graduates looking for work in Hangzhou can spend a week in government-managed accommodations , free of charge. For those who qualify as high-level talent, Hangzhou supplements housing costs and daily expenses with hundreds of thousands of RMB.\nAlibaba Cloud, China’s largest cloud platform, provides computing power to startups, ThinkChina reported . In addition, many companies have stockpiles of Nvidia GPUs, supplemented by homegrown processors from Huawei and Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corporation.\nWhy it matters: The world needs many AI centers, and Hangzhou is bringing its own distinctive character to AI development.\nWe’re thinking: In the U.S., tech companies are concentrated in a few cities, notably in Northern California. But as countries across the globe venture into AI, they would be wise to try and establish multiple hubs.\nGoogle determined that its large language models have a smaller environmental footprint than previous estimates had led it to expect.\nWhat’s new: For one year, Google researchers studied the energy consumption, greenhouse gas emissions, and water consumption of the models that drove its Gemini AI assistant in applications like Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Flights, and Maps. (They didn’t identify the specific models involved.) They found that the impact of processing a single prompt was roughly comparable to loading a web page or streaming a brief video to a television screen.\nHow it works: The authors confined their study to inference in text-processing tasks, calculating the impact of processing a single “median” prompt (one that consumes the median amount of energy across all prompts and models). They considered only activities under Google’s operational control, including data-center construction and hardware manufacturing, but not including internet routing or end-user devices.\nEnergy: The authors measured energy used to classify prompts, route them to specific models, and rank potential responses. To accomplish this, they traced the hardware used and measured energy consumption of all hardware components within a server rack, including idle machines, active processors, and cooling systems. TPUs, Google’s custom AI processors, accounted for 58 percent of the total energy consumption.\nEmissions: The authors calculated greenhouse gas emissions by multiplying the energy consumed per median-length prompt by the previous year’s average emissions per unit of electricity plus operational emissions from sources like heating and air conditioning as well as embodied emissions like hardware manufacturing and transportation, and building the data center itself. They estimated operational and embodied emissions using results from this study .\nWater: Water is used to cool data-center hardware, and around 80 percent of it evaporates. The authors measured water input minus water returned in 2023 and 2024. This enabled them to calculate water usage per energy (1.15 liter per kilowatt hour), which they multiplied by the amount of energy used per prompt to calculate the water usage per prompt.\nResults: The energy and water consumed and greenhouse gases emitted by Gemini AI assistant’s models fell well below Google’s estimates in previous years. Moreover, between May 2024 and May 2025, given a median prompt, the models’ energy consumption fell by a factor of 33 and their greenhouse gas emissions fell by a factor of 44, reductions attributable to clean-energy procurement and more energy-efficient hardware and software.\nA median text prompt consumed approximately 0.24 watt-hours, around the amount of energy that a television screen consumes over 9 seconds.\nThe median prompt consumed 0.26 milliliters of water, about five drops.\nEach median prompt generated about 0.03 grams of greenhouse gases, roughly the amount emitted when loading a single webpage.\nBehind the news: Recently, Mistral assessed its Mistral Large 2 model in a similar way (although its study included training). It found that, at inference, 400-token prompt generated 1.14 grams of greenhouse gases and consumed 45 milliliters of water.\nYes, but: Earlier research arrived at measurements as much as two orders of magnitude higher than Google’s, largely because they included factors that Google did not, The Verge reported . For instance, a 2023 study found that GPT-3 used about 10 milliliters to 50 milliliters of water per (average) prompt — greater than Google’s Gemini findings by 40 to 200 times. That study included water used in generating electricity, such as steam used to turn turbines or water used to cool nuclear generators, which Google omitted. Further, the 2023 study based its estimate of greenhouse gas emissions on actual emissions of local grids, while Google based its measurement on the company’s commitments to buy energy from low-carbon sources. Google did not respond to questions from The Verge .\nWhy it matters: Assessing the environmental cost of AI has proven to be difficult, and different approaches paint very different pictures. Google’s approach has the benefit of focusing on variables under its control and addressing energy, greenhouse gases, and water. However, it leaves out important contributors to these measures — including training — as well as consumption of materials, as highlighted in Mistral’s assessment.\nWe’re thinking: The AI industry needs a standard method that would enable AI companies to report their models’ environmental impacts and the public to compare them. Kudos to Google, Mistral, and the independent researchers for proposing practical approaches and continuing to refine them.\nAutonomous agents built on large language models introduce distinct security concerns. Researchers designed a system to protect agents from common vulnerabilities.\nWhat’s new: Sahana Chennabasappa and colleagues at Meta released LlamaFirewall , an open-source system designed to mitigate three lines of attack: (i) jailbreaking (prompts that bypass an LLM’s built-in safeguards), (ii) goal hijacking (inputs that aim to change an LLM’s prompted goal), and (iii) exploiting vulnerabilities in generated code. The code and models are freely available for projects that have up to 700 million monthly active users.\nKey insight: Security for LLMs typically focuses on filtering inputs and fine-tuning outputs. But agentic LLMs retain vulnerabilities that aren’t addressed by those techniques and present new ones as well. Receiving instructions exposes them to jailbreaking, tool use makes them vulnerable to goal hijacking (for instance, when an agent conducts a web search and encounters malicious data), and output code may open security holes outside the agent itself. To defend against these weaknesses, a security system can filter malicious prompts, monitor chains of thought for deviations from prompted goals, and check generated code for flaws.\nHow it works: LlamaFirewall integrates three modules:\nPromptGuard 2: To block malicious inputs, DeBERTa , an 86 million parameter transformer fine-tuned to classify prompts as benign or malicious, classifies incoming text from users or external tools.\nAlignmentCheck: To detect goal hijacking, Llama 4 Maverick compares chains of thought, tool calls, and output with the user’s objective as stated in the initial prompt. If the generated text or tool calls drift away from the user’s intended objective, LlamaFirewall stops the generation.\nCodeShield: To check generated code for flaws, this module uses rules to detect insecure patterns in generated code, such as vulnerability to SQL injections (like \"SELECT * FROM users WHERE email LIKE '\" + domain + \"'\", which allows SQL injections through the unsanitized input parameter  “domain”). It prevents insecure code from being passed to users until the agent fixes the code and it passes review.\nResults: The authors evaluated LlamaFirewall using AgentDojo , an environment that evaluates attacks against 10 agents (10 different LLMs coupled with the authors’ agentic framework).\nWith LlamaFirewall, attacks were successful 1.7 percent of the time. Without it, they succeeded 17.6 percent of the time.\nAlignmentCheck detected 83 percent of attacks in a proprietary dataset with a false-positive rate of 2.5 percent.\nThe authors tuned PromptGuard 2’s classification threshold to achieve a false-positive rate of 1 percent. At this rate, PromptGuard 2 detected 97.5 percent of attacks in a proprietary dataset.\nThe authors also compared the performance of PromptGuard 2 to competing prompt classifiers using AgentDojo. With PromptGuard 2, 3.3 percent of jailbreak attempts were successful. Using the next-best competitor, ProtectAI , 13.7 percent succeeded.\nWhy it matters: The rise of agentic systems is opening new vectors of cyberattack, and security risks are likely to rise as agents operate with greater autonomy and perform more critical tasks. LlamaFirewall addresses a wide range of potential security issues in an open-source tool kit.\nWe’re thinking: This work is a helpful reminder that, while generative LLMs are all the rage, BERT-style classifiers remain useful when an application needs to classify text quickly.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 316\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nParallel agents are emerging as an important new direction for scaling up AI. AI capabilities have scaled with more training data, training-time compute, and test-time compute. Having multiple agents run in parallel is growing as a technique to further scale and improve performance.\nWe know from work at Baidu by my former team, and later OpenAI, that AI models’ performance scales predictably with the amount of data and training computation. Performance rises further with test-time compute such as in agentic workflows and in reasoning models that think, reflect, and iterate on an answer. But these methods take longer to produce output. Agents working in parallel offer another path to improve results, without making users wait.\nReasoning models generate tokens sequentially and can take a long time to run. Similarly, most agentic workflows are initially implemented in a sequential way. But as LLM prices per token continue to fall — thus making these techniques practical — and product teams want to deliver results to users faster, more and more agentic workflows are being parallelized.\nSome examples:\nMany research agents now fetch multiple web pages and examine their texts in parallel to try to synthesize deeply thoughtful research reports more quickly.\nSome agentic coding frameworks allow users to orchestrate many agents working simultaneously on different parts of a code base. Our short course on Claude Code shows how to do this using git worktrees.\nA rapidly growing design pattern for agentic workflows is to have a compute-heavy agent work for minutes or longer to accomplish a task, while another agent monitors the first and gives brief updates to the user to keep them informed. From here, it’s a short hop to parallel agents that work in the background while the UI agent keeps users informed and perhaps also routes asynchronous user feedback to the other agents.\nIt is difficult for a human manager to take a complex task (like building a complex software application) and break it down into smaller tasks for human engineers to work on in parallel; scaling to huge numbers of engineers is especially challenging. Similarly, it is also challenging to decompose tasks for parallel agents to carry out. But the falling cost of LLM inference makes it worthwhile to use a lot more tokens, and using them in parallel allows this to be done without significantly increasing the user’s waiting time.\nI am also encouraged by the growing body of research on parallel agents. For example, I enjoyed reading “ CodeMonkeys: Scaling Test-Time Compute for Software Engineering ” by Ryan Ehrlich and others, which shows how parallel code generation helps you to explore the solution space. The mixture-of-agents architecture by Junlin Wang is a surprisingly simple way to organize parallel agents: Have multiple LLMs come up with different answers, then have an aggregator LLM combine them into the final output.\nThere remains a lot of research as well as engineering to explore how best to leverage parallel agents, and I believe the number of agents that can work productively in parallel — like the humans who can work productively in parallel — will be very high.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nAutomate knowledge graph construction using AI agents. Implement a multi-agent system that captures goals, selects relevant data, generates schemas for structured and unstructured sources, and constructs and connects the resulting graphs into a queryable knowledge graph. Enroll for free\nGoogle’s latest smartphone sports an AI assistant that anticipates the user’s needs and presents helpful information without prompting.\nWhat’s new: Google unveiled its Pixel 10 along with an AI-powered system called Magic Cue. During calling, texting, and other interactions, the system automatically delivers relevant information — dates, times, names, locations, weather, photos, airline booking numbers, and so on — culled from compatible applications.\nHow it works: Magic Cue takes advantage of an updated version of Gemini Nano and runs on the Pixel 10’s newly upgraded Tensor G5 AI processor. The system tracks user behavior and provides relevant information proactively.\nMagic Cue does not require wake words or prompts. It runs in the background and responds to the phone’s state from moment to moment.\nThe system’s output appears within the current app as a floating overlay window.\nIn an example provided by Google, if a user receives a text asking when their flight is scheduled to land, Magic Cue will access the user’s itinerary, extract relevant details, and offer the opportunity to insert them into a reply. If the user calls the airline to change the flight, the system will respond by displaying the flight information.\nBehind the news: Google has been especially aggressive in building AI into phones. In 2021, it replaced the Qualcomm Snapdragon chip that had run AI inference on Pixel phones with its own Tensor chip, which combined a GPU, CPU, Tensor processing unit, and security subsystem. Three years later, the Pixel 8’s Tensor G3 chip provided the muscle for AI-enabled audio and video editing — but those capabilities were features within applications. Equipped with the new Tensor G5, Pixel 10 integrates AI with the operating system and applications to provide new kinds of capabilities.\nWhy it matters: Enabling edge devices to run powerful AI models has been a longstanding goal of big tech companies. But a smartphone’s relatively meager computational, storage, and battery resources have presented serious challenges . The combination of Gemini Nano and the Tensor G5 chip gives Google a strong foundation to keep pushing the limits of edge AI, and its control of the Android operating system gives it tremendous market power to promote its models.\nWe’re thinking: Apple has noticed Google’s progress. It’s reportedly negotiating with Google to use Gemini technology for its Siri AI assistant.\nThe French AI company Mistral measured the environmental impacts of its flagship large language model.\nWhat’s new: Mistral published an environmental analysis of Mistral Large 2 (123 billion parameters) that details the model’s emission of greenhouse gases, consumption of water, and depletion of resources, taking into account all computing and manufacturing involved. The company aims to establish a standard for evaluating the environmental impacts of AI models. The study concluded that, while individual uses of the model have little impact compared to, say, using the internet, aggregate use takes a significant toll on the environment.\nHow it works: Mistral tracked the model’s operations over 18 months. It tallied impacts caused by the building of data centers, manufacturing and transporting servers, training and running the model, the user’s equipment, and indirect impacts of using the model. The analysis followed the Frugal AI methodology developed by Association Française de Normalisation, a French standards organization. Environmental consultancies contributed to the analysis, and environmental auditors peer-reviewed it.\nTraining Mistral Large 2 produced 20,400 metric tons of greenhouse gases. That’s roughly equal to annual emissions from 4,400 gas-powered passenger vehicles .\nTraining consumed 281,000 cubic meters of water for cooling via evaporation, roughly as much as the average U.S. family of four would consume in 500 years. (1.5 cubic meters per day x 365 days x 500 years.)\nTraining and inference accounted for 85.5 percent of the model’s greenhouse-gas emissions, 91 percent of its water consumption, and 29 percent of materials consumption including energy infrastructure.\nManufacturing, transporting, and decommissioning servers accounted for 11 percent of greenhouse gas emissions, 5 percent of water consumption, and 61 percent of overall materials consumed.\nNetwork traffic came to less than 1 percent of each of the three measures.\nThe average prompt and response (400 tokens or a page of text) emitted 1.14 grams of greenhouse gases, about the amount produced by watching a YouTube clip (10 seconds in the U.S. or 55 seconds in France where low-emissions nuclear energy is more widely available), and consumed 45 milliliters or 3 tablespoons of water. The total materials consumption was roughly equivalent to manufacturing a 2 Euro coin.\nYes, but: Mistral acknowledged a few shortcomings of the study. It struggled to calculate some impacts due to the lack of data and established standards. For instance, a reliable assessment of the environmental impact of GPUs is not available.\nBehind the news: Mistral’s report follows a string of studies that assess AI’s environmental impact.\nWhile AI is likely to consume increasing amounts of energy, it could also produce huge energy savings in coming years, according to a report by the International Energy Agency, which advises 44 countries on energy policy.\nA 2023 analysis by University of California and University of Texas quantified GPT-3-175B’s consumption of water. The conclusions of that work align with those of Mistral’s analysis.\nA 2021 paper identified ways to make AI models up to a thousand-fold more energy-efficient by streamlining architectures, upgrading hardware, and boosting the energy efficiency of data centers.\nWhy it matters: AI consumes enormous amounts of energy and water, and finding efficient ways to train and run models is critical to ensure that the technology can benefit large numbers of people. Mistral’s approach provides a standardized approach to assessing the environmental impacts. If it’s widely adopted, it could help researchers, businesses, and users compare different models, work toward more environmentally friendly AI, and potentially reduce overall impacts.\nWe’re thinking: Data centers and cloud computing are responsible for 1 percent of the world’s energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. That’s a drop in the bucket compared to agriculture, construction, or transportation. Nonetheless, having a clear picture of AI’s consumption of resources can help us manage them more effectively as demand rises. It's heartening that major AI companies are committed to using and developing sustainable energy sources and using them efficiently, and the environmental footprint of new AI models and processors is falling steadily.\nResearchers in China disguised a quadruped robot as a Tibetan antelope to help study the animals close-up.\nWhat’s new: The Chinese Academy of Sciences teamed with Hangzhou-based Deep Robotics and the state news service Xinhua to introduce a robot into a herd that lives in the Hoh Xil National Nature Reserve, a mountainous area where the elevation is above 14,000 feet. The robot enables scientists to observe the shy antelopes without disturbing them.\nHow it works: The mechanical beast is a Deep Robotics X30 covered with an antelope’s hide. The X30, which is designed for industrial inspections and search-and-rescue tasks, is well suited to the region’s rugged terrain and conditions. It can climb open-riser staircases, function at temperatures between -20° and 55° Celsius, and resist dust and water according to ratings established by the International Electrotechnical Commission. Its vision system is designed to operate in dim or very bright light.\nDeep Robotics has published little information about the X30’s training, though it has said the robot learned to navigate rough terrain via the reinforcement learning algorithm proximal policy optimization (PPO). However, its GitHub repository reveals details about its robot for the consumer market, Lite3. (The two are similar, but their training may not be.) Lite3 used multiple vanilla neural networks; first to embed current and previous joint positions and velocities and then to calculate joint motions. Lite3 learned via PPO to move a simulated robot across various terrains (flat, sloped, staircased, random, and so on) in the Isaac Gym simulator. It received rewards when the simulated robot moved forward or took larger steps, and it received punishment when the robot moved too fast, failed to move, fell over, collided with objects, and so on.\nThe X30 is equipped with cameras (two hidden beneath its fake eyes plus a wide-angle camera), LiDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and a GPS system with a real-time kinematics module for more precise location tracking. Its computer-vision software automatically tracks the herd’s movement, feeding, and reproduction and transmits data via 5G radio. If it detects the herd nearing a road, it sends an alert so its operators can direct automobile traffic, allowing the animals to cross safely.\nIt can be controlled remotely up to 1.2 miles away. Its top speed is 8 miles per hour, while Tibetan antelopes can move as fast as 50 miles per hour. Its battery lasts up to 4 hours and features a quick-release mechanism for streamlined swapping.\nBehind the news: Human observation can disrupt animal behavior, so the study of animals in their natural habitat relies mostly on camera traps and drones. Increasingly, biologists are experimenting with robots mocked up to look like animals.\nIn Florida, robot bunnies automatically lure invasive Burmese pythons and alert researchers when their sensors detect the reptiles.\nRobot falcons that fly thanks to wing-mounted propellers scare birds from airport runways to reduce the risk that they’ll interfere with aircraft.\nWhy it matters: Applying AI to robotic perception, locomotion, and dexterity opens a wide range of applications. Case in point: Deep Robotics’ PPO training enables its robots to navigate difficult environments (like climbing uneven staircases) and respond to dynamic challenges (like being kicked down a flight of stairs ). Such capabilities are valuable not only in domestic and industrial uses but also research situations like observing antelope behavior.\nWe’re thinking: Robotics is making impressive strides!\nDINOv2 showed that a vision transformer pretrained on unlabeled images could produce embeddings that are useful for a wide variety of tasks. Now it has been updated to improve the performance of its embeddings in segmentation and other vision tasks.\nWhat’s new: Oriane Siméoni and colleagues at Meta, World Resources Institute, and France’s National Institute for Research in Digital Science and Technology released the weights and training code for DINOv3 , a self-supervised model that updates the previous version with 6 times more parameters trained on more data plus a new loss function.\nInput/output: Image in, embedding out\nArchitecture: 6.7 billion-parameter vision transformer\nPerformance: Outstanding image segmentation and depth estimation\nTraining data: Over 1.7 billion images from public Instagram posts\nAvailability: Weights and training code are available via a license that allows non-commercial and commercial uses but forbids military applications\nUndisclosed: Input size limit\nKey insight: Vision transformers trained in a self-supervised fashion —  such as feeding them unlabeled images with missing patches and training them to fill in the blanks — yield uneven results beyond a certain number of training steps . Further training increases performance on tasks that depend on analyzing an image globally, like classification and face recognition, but degrades it in tasks that concentrate on portions of an image, like image segmentation and depth estimation. The DINOv3 team discovered the reason: The model’s embeddings of random patches become more similar as training continues. To counteract this, they used the model trained up to that point as a teacher and trained successive versions to avoid producing patch embeddings that were more similar to one another than the teacher’s embeddings were.\nHow it works: The building of DINOv3 followed that of its predecessor DINOv2 but added a new loss term.\nThe team trained DINOv3 to embed images of size 256x256 pixels for the first 1 million steps. During this phase, they measured how well DINOv3 segmented many images after different numbers of training steps. For each test, they froze the model and trained a linear layer, given an embedding of an image from the PASCAL VOC dataset that includes images and segmentation maps, to segment the image. The model’s segmentation score (measured using mean intersection over union, the overlap between the model’s output and ground truth) peaked after around 100,000 training steps and decreased steadily after around 200,000 training steps.\nTo enable the model to relearn how to produce different patch embeddings — a skill increasingly lost during the first phase of training — they continued to train DINOv3 for another 10,000 to 30,000 steps using an additional loss term. The new loss term aimed to minimize the difference in the degrees of similarity between patch embeddings produced by the current model and those produced by the model at 100,000 training steps. They compared the degree of dissimilarity rather than comparing the embeddings themselves so the model learned to make embeddings that are different from those produced by its less-trained counterpart but different to the degree that is associated with good performance on tasks like segmentation.\nThey trained the model in the same way for another 10,000 steps on image sizes up to 768x768 pixels.\nResults: The authors adapted the trained embedding model for various uses by adding separate linear layers and training them on tasks including segmentation and classification.\nSegmenting images in PASCAL VOC, DINOv3 achieved 86.6 mean IoU (intersection over union, higher is better). DINOv2 achieved 83.1 mean IoU, and SigLIP 2 , a model trained via weak supervision to produce similar embeddings of text and images, achieved 72.7 mean IoU.\nClassifying images in ImageNet, DINOv3 (88.4 percent accuracy) outperformed the next-best self-supervised model DINOv2 (87.3 percent accuracy). It underperformed two weakly supervised models, SigLIP 2 (89.1 percent accuracy) and PECore (89.3 percent accuracy).\nWhy it matters: Unsupervised learning is important in visual AI because image and video data are more common than image-text and video-text data. The additional loss term enabled the team to use this more plentiful data to improve performance on both globally and locally focused tasks.\nWe’re thinking: Model builders have raced to make ever bigger large language models trained on more data, and their performance has improved with each leap in size. That hasn’t happened with vision transformers, but DINOv3, which is 6 times larger and trained on an order of magnitude more data than its predecessor, suggests that it could.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 315\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nOn Saturday at the Buildathon hosted by AI Fund and DeepLearning.AI, over 100 developers competed to build software products quickly using AI assisted coding. I was inspired to see developers build functional products in just 1-2 hours. The best practices for rapid engineering are changing quickly along with the tools, and I loved the hallway conversations sharing tips with other developers on using AI to code!\nThe competitors raced to fulfill product specs like this one (you can see the full list here ):\nProject: Codebase Time Machine Description: Navigate any codebase through time, understanding evolution of features and architectural decisions. Requirements:\nClone repo and analyze full git history\nBuild semantic understanding of code changes over time\nAnswer questions like “Why was this pattern introduced?” or “Show me how auth evolved”\nVisualize code ownership and complexity trends\nLink commits to business features/decisions\nTeams had 6½ hours to build 5 products. And many of them managed to do exactly that! They created fully functional applications with good UIs and sometimes embellishments.\nWhat excites me most isn’t just what can now be built in a few hours. Rather, it is that, if AI assistance lets us build basic but fully functional products this quickly, then imagine what can now be done in a week, or a month, or six months. If the teams that participated in the Buildathon had this velocity of execution and iterated over multiple cycles of getting customer feedback and using that to improve the product, imagine how quickly it is now possible to build great products.\nOwning proprietary software has long been a moat for businesses, because it has been hard to write complex software. Now, as AI assistance enables rapid engineering, this moat is weakening.\nWhile many members of the winning teams had computer science backgrounds — which does provide an edge — not all did. Team members who took home prizes included a high school senior, a product manager, and a healthcare entrepreneur who initially posted on Discord that he was “over his skis” as someone who “isn't a coder.” I was thrilled that multiple participants told me they exceeded their own expectations and discovered they can now build faster than they realized.

Get your tickets here\nNvidia and AMD, having obtained the U.S. government’s permission to resume selling AI processors in China, received a cool welcome there.\nWhat’s new: China’s government, which is wary of U.S. control over the country’s supply of high-end GPUs, is requiring Nvidia processors to undergo a security review, The Wall Street Journal reported . While the review is underway, the authorities are urging Chinese AI companies to buy domestic GPUs. DeepSeek reportedly tried and failed to use China-native Huawei GPUs to train DeepSeek-R2, the follow-up to its DeepSeek-R1 model, which has delayed the project, according to Financial Times .\nHow it works: The Chinese government’s resistance to AI processors from U.S. vendors signals rising confidence in the nation’s AI capabilities, as the U.S. seeks to return to selling advanced processors in China after blocking such sales in recent months. China is helping the domestic semiconductor industry to compete against U.S. designers like Nvidia and AMD and the Taiwanese manufacturer TSMC, which fabricates their products, by providing funds and tax incentives and applying pressure to Chinese AI companies to buy processors made domestically. Meanwhile, Chinese vendors aim to close the performance gap between their products and those of U.S. competitors.\nChina raised security concerns about U.S. processors. The government required Nvidia to explain alleged “backdoor security risks” of its H20 processor, which is designed to comply with U.S. export restrictions. China cited information it said it had obtained from U.S. artificial intelligence experts that the H20 could be shut down remotely and used to track users’ locations. Nvidia disputed those claims. (The H20’s processing power is roughly comparable with that of the Huawei Ascend 910B/C and less than that of Nvidia’s most advanced products, but its memory capacity and bandwidth are superior to Huawei’s best and closer to its Nvidia peers.)\nChina questioned domestic technology firms including Baidu, ByteDance, and Tencent about their desires to use U.S. processors.\nChina’s scrutiny of U.S. processors could set back Nvidia. In July, the company placed orders to manufacture 300,000 H20 chipsets and warned customers that demand might outstrip supply.\nBehind the news: The U.S. government restricted sales of U.S. AI processors to China in 2022. The Trump administration tightened the restriction but recently reversed course.\nIn April, the White House effectively banned sales to China of advanced chips that use U.S. technology by making them subject to export licenses, which apparently were not forthcoming.\nIn recent weeks, the White House lifted the ban. In return, China agreed to sell to the U.S. rare-earth minerals and magnets derived from them, which are critical components in a wide range of consumer and industrial devices including smartphones, hard disks, and electric cars. In an unusual arrangement, U.S. chip vendors will be required to pay to the U.S. government an export license fee of 15 percent of their revenue from sales to China.\nNvidia is developing a scaled-down, low-cost processor for the Chinese market based on its upcoming Blackwell chip architecture. The White House said it may allow Nvidia to export such processors to China.\nWhy it matters: The U.S. and China are wary that the other will gain a strategic advantage in technological, economic, or military power. Leadership in AI is central to all three areas. While U.S. AI companies have developed cutting-edge proprietary models, their counterparts in China have pulled ahead in open models on which anyone can build applications free of charge. But processors remain a sticking point. Spurred by U.S. export controls and policy shifts, which have made the U.S. an unreliable supplier, China is doubling down on its own semiconductor industry in hope of catching up with — and advancing beyond — Nvidia and TSMC.\nWe’re thinking: Developers around the world use open-weights models from China. Whether they will also adopt AI processors from China is an open question.\nThe mixture-of-experts approach that has boosted the performance of large language models may do the same for video generation.\nWhat’s new: Alibaba released Wan 2.2 , an open-weights family of video generation models that includes versions built on a novel mixture-of-experts (MoE) flow-matching architecture. Wan2.2-T2V-A14B generates video from text input, Wan2.2-I2V-A14B generates video from images, and Wan2.2-TI2V-5B generates video from either text or images. At 5 billion parameters, Wan2.2-TI2V-5B runs on consumer GPUs.\nInput/output: Wan2.2-T2V-A14B : Text up to 512 tokens in, video up to 5 second out (30 frames per second, up to 1280x720 pixels per frame). Wan2.2-I2V-A14B : Images up to 1280x720 pixels in, video up to 5 seconds out (30 frames per second, up to 1280x720 pixels per frame). Wan2.2-TI2V-5B : Text up to 512 tokens and/or images up to 1280x704 pixels in, video up to 5 seconds out (24 frames per second, 1280x704 pixels per frame).\nArchitecture: UMT5 transformer to encode text, 3D convolutional variational autoencoder (VAE) to encode and decode images, flow-matching model to generate output: MoE transformer, 27 billion parameters total, 14 billion active per token (Wan2.2-T2V-A14B and Wan2.2-I2V-A14B) or transformer (Wan2.2-TI2V-5B).\nAvailability: Web interface (free), weights available via HuggingFace and ModelScope for commercial and non-commercial uses under Apache 2.0 license, API (MoE models only) $0.02 per second of 480p output, $0.10 per second of 1080p output (API only)\nUndisclosed: VAE parameter count, training data, differences in training methods between Wan 2.2 and the earlier Wan 2.1\nHow it works: The team pretrained the VAE to encode and decode images. They pretrained the flow-matching model, given a video embedding from the VAE with noise added and a text embedding from UMT5, to remove the noise over several steps.\nThe MoE model has two experts: one for very noisy inputs and one for less noisy inputs. One expert generates the objects and their positions across a video, the other handles details.\nTo determine which expert to use, the model computes the signal-to-noise ratio of the noisy embedding. Specifically, it starts with the high-noise expert, determines the time step at which the proportion of noise has fallen by half, and switches to the low-noise expert after that time step.\nAt inference, the VAE embeds an input image (if applicable) and UMT5 embeds input text (if applicable). The model concatenates the image embedding (if applicable) with an embedding of noise. Given the noisy embedding and text embedding, the flow-matching model removes noise over several steps. Finally, the VAE decodes the denoised embedding to produce video output.\nResults: Results for Wan 2.2 are limited. The team shared only the performance of the MoE models on a proprietary benchmark, Wan-Bench-2.0, whose mechanics, categories, and units it has not yet described. The team compared Wan2.2-T2V-A14B to competitors including Bytedance Seedance 1.0, Kuaishou KLING 2.0, and OpenAI Sora.\nFor esthetic quality, Wan2.2-T2V-A14B (85.3) outperformed second-best Seedance 1.0 (84.3).\nIt also achieved the highest scores for dynamic output, rendered text, and the prompt control over the camera.\nFor video fidelity, Wan2.2-T2V-A14B (73.7) came in second to Seedance (81.8).\nBehind the news: Open models for video generation have been proliferating. Within the last year, there are Mochi , HunyuanVideo , LTX-Video , pyramid-flow-sd3 , CogVideoX , and more.\nWhy it matters: MoE architectures have become popular for their superior performance in text generation. Selecting the expert(s) to use for a given input often is done either by a router that learns which expert(s) work best for a given token or based on the input data type. This work is closer to the latter. The model selects the appropriate expert based on the noise in the input.\nWe’re thinking: Video generation is exploding! Proprietary systems generally have made deeper inroads into the professional studios, but open models like this show great promise.\nOpenAI is working with Oracle to build its next chunk of processing power, a $30 billion outgrowth of the partners’ $500 billion Stargate project and a sign of OpenAI’s ongoing thirst for computation.\nWhat’s new: OpenAI and Oracle plan to build data-center capacity that will consume 4.5 gigawatts of electrical power, an order of magnitude more than one of the largest data centers under construction Microsoft, which currently provides OpenAI’s computational muscle. The locations have not yet been announced.\nHow it works: The plan follows the successful launch of an OpenAI-Oracle data center built in Abilene, Texas, that serves as a proof of concept. That project will draw 1.2 gigawatts when it’s finished next year.\nOpenAI will pay Oracle $30 billion annually, The Wall Street Journal reported .\nOpenAI wrote in a blog post that it expects to exceed its planned $500 billion data-center buildout dubbed Stargate , and that it’s assessing sites with Stargate partner SoftBank.\nIn October 2024, Altman complained in a Reddit Ask Me Anything session that a lack of processing power has delayed the company’s products.\nBehind the news: Stargate, a partnership among OpenAI, Oracle, and Softbank, was announced by President Trump at the White House alongside the executive order that called for the U.S. government’s recent AI action plan .\nThe partners aimed to spend $500 billion over four years to build 20 data centers. OpenAI would receive processing power, Oracle would provide hardware and software infrastructure, and SoftBank would secure financing.\nOther participants in Stargate include the Colorado-based builder Crusoe, Emirati AI-investment fund MGX, OpenAI’s infrastructure partner Microsoft, and Nvidia.\nWhy it matters: Staying at the forefront of AI requires immense amounts of computation, despite innovations in more compute-efficient model architectures and training and inference techniques. But how to get it? For OpenAI, the answer is forming strong ties to large-scale providers of cloud computing; first Microsoft, now Oracle. The OpenAI-Oracle partnership enables OpenAI to continue to develop models at pace and at scale, while it enables Oracle to gain experience and credibility as a provider of large-scale computing for cutting-edge AI.\nWe’re thinking: OpenAI’s plan to build 20 giant data centers — even more, based on the company’s latest statement —  poses a major challenge to existing energy resources. Having SoftBank as a partner may be a significant advantage as that company ramps up its investments in power generation specifically for AI.\nBenchmarks can measure how well large language models apply what they’ve learned from their training data to new data, but it’s harder to measure the degree to which they simply memorized their training data. New work proposes a way to gauge memorization.\nWhat’s new: John X. Morris and colleagues at Meta, Google, Cornell University, and Nvidia developed a method that measures the number of bits a model memorizes during training.\nKey insight: A model’s negative log likelihood is equal to the minimum number of bits needed to represent a given piece of data. The more likely the model is to generate the data, the fewer bits needed to represent it. If, to represent a given output, a hypothetical best model requires more bits than a trained model, then the trained model must have memorized that many bits of that output. The best model is hypothetical, but a better-performing model can stand in for it. The difference in the numbers of bits used to represent the output by this superior model and the trained model is a lower bound on the number of bits the trained model has memorized.\nHow it works: The authors trained hundreds of GPT-2 style models to predict the next token in two text datasets: (i) a synthetic dataset of 64-token strings in which each token was generated randomly and (ii) the FineWeb dataset of text from the web, its examples truncated to 64 tokens and deduplicated. They trained models from 100,000 to 20 million parameters on subsets of these datasets from 16,000 to 4 million examples. Then they computed the how much of the datasets the models had memorized:\nThe authors computed the number of bits needed to represent each training example based on the likelihoods of the trained model and a superior model. For models trained on synthetic data, the superior model was the distribution used to generate the data. For models trained on a subset of FineWeb, they used GPT-2 trained on all FineWeb examples (after truncation and deduplication).\nThey subtracted the number of bits computed for the superior model from the number computed for the trained model. A positive difference indicated the amount of memorization. A zero or negative difference indicated that memorization did not occur.\nTo find the amount of data the model had memorized. they summed the number of bits memorized per example.\nResults: The maximum number of bits a model memorized rose linearly with its parameter count regardless of the training dataset, amount of training data, or model size.\nTrained on synthetic data, a model’s memorization increased linearly and then plateaued after a certain amount of training data.\nMaximum memorization was approximately 3.5 to 3.6 bits per parameter (their models used 16 bits to represent each parameter).\nTrained on FineWeb, a model’s memorization increased linearly with the amount of training data before decreasing as the model started to generalize (that is, the number of bits memorized per parameter fell and benchmark scores rose). This result showed that models memorize until they reach a maximum capacity and then start to generalize.\nWhy it matters: Some previous efforts to measure memorization calculated the percentage of examples for which, given an initial sequence of tokens, a model would generate the rest. However, generating a repetitive sequence like “dog dog dog…” does not mean that a model has memorized it, and solving a simple arithmetic problem does not mean the model has memorized it or even encountered it in its training data. This work provides a theoretical basis for estimating how much of their training sets models memorize. It also lays a foundation for further work to reduce memorization without increasing the sizes of training datasets.\nWe’re thinking: It’s well known that more training data helps models to generalize. This work shows how to estimate the amount of data necessary before models begin to generalize.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 314\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nJust as many businesses are transforming to become more capable by using AI, universities are too. I recently visited the UK to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Exeter’s Faculty of Environment, Science and Economy. The name of this faculty stood out to me as a particularly forward-looking way to organize an academic division. Having Computer Science sit alongside Environmental Science and the Business School creates natural opportunities for collaboration across these fields.\nLeveraging AI leads a university to do things differently. Speaking with Vice Chancellor Lisa Roberts, Deputy Vice Chancellor Timothy Quine, and CS Department Head Andrew Howes, I was struck by the university leadership’s pragmatic and enthusiastic embrace of AI. This is not a group whose primary worry is whether students will cheat using AI. This is a group that is thinking about how to create a student body that is empowered through AI, whether by teaching more students to code, helping them use AI tools effectively, or showing them what’s newly possible in their disciplines.\nExeter is a wonderful place to create synergies between AI, environmental science, and business. It hosts 5 of the world’s top 21 most influential climate scientists according to Reuters , and its scholars are major contributors to reports by the UN’s IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) as well as pioneers in numerous areas of climate research including geoengineering, which I wrote about previously. Its Centre for Environmental Intelligence, a partnership with the Met Office (the UK’s national weather service), applies AI to massive climate datasets. More work like this is needed to understand climate change and strategies for mitigation and adaptation. Add to this its Business School — named Business School of the Year by the consultancy Times Higher Education — and you have the ingredients for building applications and pursuing interdisciplinary studies that span technological, environmental, and economic realities.\nHaving been born in the UK and spent most of my career in Silicon Valley, I find it exciting to see Exeter’s leadership embrace AI with an enthusiasm I more often associate with California. The UK has always punched above its weight in research, and seeing that tradition continue in the AI era is encouraging.\nJust as every company is becoming an AI company, every university must become an AI university — not just teaching AI, but using it to advance every field of study. This doesn’t mean abandoning disciplinary expertise. It means maintaining technical excellence while ensuring AI enhances every field.\nLike almost all other universities and businesses worldwide, Exeter’s AI transformation is just beginning. But the enthusiastic embrace of AI by its leadership will give it momentum. As someone who is proud to be an honorary graduate of the university, I look forward to seeing what comes next!\nKeep building,\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nBuild working GenAI app prototypes in hours, not weeks.

Learn more and enroll now!\nOpenAI launched GPT-5, the highly anticipated successor to its groundbreaking series of large language models, but glitches in the rollout left many early users disappointed and frustrated.\nWhat’s new: Rather than a family of models, GPT-5 is a family of systems — GPT-5, GPT-5 Mini, GPT-5 Nano, and GPT-5 Pro — that include non-reasoning and variable-reasoning models along with a router that switches between them automatically depending on the input. OpenAI made GPT-5 the only option in the ChatGPT user interface without prior notice, but the router failed right out of the gate, causing the company to reinstate ChatGPT access to earlier models for paid users.\nInput/output: Text and images in (up to 272,000 tokens), text out (up to 128,000 tokens including reasoning and response, 122 tokens per second, 72 seconds to first token )\nPerformance: Outperforms previous OpenAI models on most benchmarks reported; tops competing models on some benchmarks of math, coding , and multimodal abilities as well as health knowledge; reduced hallucinations\nFeatures: Developer options include four levels of reasoning, three levels of verbosity (output length), tool calling via JSON or natural language, selectable non-reasoning and reasoning models, summaries of reasoning tokens\nAvailability/price: Via API GPT-5 $1.25/$0.13/$10 per million input/cached/output tokens, GPT-5 Mini $0.25/$0.025/$2 per million input/cached/output tokens, GPT-5 Nano $0.05/$0.005/$0.40 per million input/cached/output tokens; via ChatGPT free limited access; via ChatGPT Pro $200/month unlimited access to GPT-5 and GPT-5 Pro\nKnowledge cutoff: September 30, 2024 (GPT-5), May 30, 2024 (GPT-5 Mini, GPT-5 Nano)\nUndisclosed: Model, router, and system architectures; training methods and data\nHow it works: OpenAI revealed few details about GPT-5’s architecture and training except “safe completions” fine-tuning to balance safety and helpfulness, which is documented in a paper .\nThe router selects between non-reasoning and reasoning models based on input “type,” “complexity,” tool requirements, and explicit user intent (such as a prompt to “think hard”). The router learns from user behavior. When ChatGPT users reach usage limits, the router directs queries to mini versions of each model.\nThe team trained the models on web content, licensed data, and human and generated input. They fine-tuned them to reason via reinforcement learning.\nIn addition, they fine-tuned the models to prefer helpful but “safe” answers over refusals to answer, an approach the team calls safe completions. Given a potentially problematic input, a model aims to respond usefully while staying within safety guidelines, explains when it must refuse, and suggests related outputs that don’t touch on topics it has been trained to avoid.\nResults: GPT-5 topped some benchmarks according to OpenAI's evaluations. However, it fell short of competing models on some measures of abstract reasoning in independent tests.\nOn SWE-bench (software engineering tasks), GPT-5 (74.9 percent accuracy) outperformed Claude Opus 4.1 ( 74.5 percent accuracy ).\nOn AIME 2025 (competition math problems), GPT-5 set to high reasoning without tools (94.6 percent accuracy) surpassed o3 set to high reasoning (88.9 percent).\nOn the EQ-Bench Creative Writing v3 benchmark (leaderboard here ), GPT-5 with an unspecified reasoning level (90.30) outperformed o3 (87.65), Gemini-2.5-pro (86.00), and Claude Opus 4 (83.75).\nOn Artificial Analysis’s Intelligence Index , a weighted average of 10 benchmarks, GPT-5 set to either high or medium reasoning exceeded all other models tested, followed by xAI Grok 4 and OpenAI o3. However, it fared worse on benchmarks of abstract reasoning without tool use. For instance, on ARC-AGI-1 and ARC-AGI-2 (visual puzzles), GPT-5 with high reasoning (65.7 percent and 9.9 percent respectively) underperformed Grok 4 Thinking (66.7 percent and 16 percent respectively).\nBehind the news: Launched in March 2023, GPT-4 raised the bar for vision-language performance, and anticipation of the next version grew steadily over the two years since. In December 2024, The Wall Street Journal reported GPT-5 was delayed as the scale of the project stretched OpenAI’s computational limits. In a mid-February 2025 post on the X social network, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman offered GPT-4.5 as a stopgap and outlined the improvements expected with GPT-5. But in April, he said GPT-5 would be delayed further and launched o3 and o4-mini, whose performance once again topped leaderboards. GPT-5’s August 7 debut brought an end to the long wait, but misleading graphs of its performance, rate limits, and the malfunctioning switcher marred the event, while the unexpected deprecation of earlier models in ChatGPT hamstrung many users.\nWhy it matters: OpenAI models have consistently topped language benchmarks. With GPT-5, the company has launched a system architecture that integrates its best models and takes advantage of the strengths of each: rapid output, slower output with adjustable computation devoted to reasoning, and graceful degradation to smaller versions.\nWe’re thinking: Novices may find that the GPT-5 router’s ability to choose a model for any given input simplifies things, but it remains to be seen whether expert users, who may be better at selecting the appropriate model for their tasks, will be happy to give up this control.\nIndia, which has limited funding and large numbers of languages and dialects, is redoubling its efforts to build native large language models.\nWhat’s new: India is funding startups and marshaling processing resources, MIT Technology Review reported . Companies such as CoRover, Sarvam AI, and Soket AI Labs are working on efficient models that can process many of the 22 officially recognized languages spoken in India while running on relatively small compute budgets.\nChallenges: India is home to more than 120 languages and 19,500 dialects. However, training models to process them faces hurdles both cultural and technical.\nSome Indian languages don’t have much written text or consistent spelling, which makes for few large, high-quality datasets for model training.\nLanguages such as Kannada and Tamil can be written without delimiters between words, such as spaces, which makes them difficult to tokenize efficiently.\nIndia lacks the financial muscle available in China, Europe, and the United States. Last year, the U.S. spent 3.5 percent of its gross domestic product on research and development, China spent 2.68 percent, and Europe spent 2.2 percent, while India spent 0.65 percent. The picture is more stark when it comes to funding startups. In 2024, U.S. AI startups amassed $97 billion in venture funding and Europe raised $51 billion, while Indian AI start-ups brought in $780.5 million.\nIndia’s technology industry has evolved to focus on services, such as those offered by giant software consultant Infosys, Tata, and HCL, rather than products.\nInitiatives: To overcome the challenges, India’s government, cloud providers, and startups are attempting to kickstart indigenous model development. Several Indian AI leaders said they’re inspired by DeepSeek, the Chinese developer that built a leading large language model while spending far less than its international competitors.\nLast year, India’s government approved a $1.2 billion investment in the IndiaAI Mission , an overarching plan to develop AI technology.\nSome of that money will bankroll efforts like one by the Indian Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY). In January, just 10 days after DeepSeek released DeepSeek-R1, MeitY called for proposals to build foundation models. It also invited cloud-computing and data‑center companies to reserve GPU compute capacity for government‑led AI research, which brought access to 19,000 GPUs including 13,000 top-of-the-line Nvidia H100s. The call netted 67 proposals.\nIn April, the government announced that it would sponsor six large-scale models. It chose Sarvam AI to build a 70-billion-parameter multilingual model with reasoning and voice capabilities (the latter being crucial in a country where many people don’t read or write). The model is expected to be available later this year.\nMeitY also chose three startups to build multilingual models. Soket AI Labs is building a 120 billion-parameter model, Gan.ai is working on a 70 billion-parameter model, and Gnani.ai is focusing on 14 billion parameters and voice capabilities.\nOther government-funded efforts already are bearing fruit. CoRover.ai built the 3.2 billion-parameter BharatGPT , India’s first government-funded multimodal model, which offers voice capabilities in 12 languages. In June, CoRover.ai launched BharatGPT Mini , a compact version that comprises 534 million parameters.\nWhy it matters: As LLMs have become more sophisticated, it has become clear that one size doesn’t fit all. Countries (and subcultures within countries) need models that reflect their values, habits of thought, and languages. Yet resources are unequally distributed, leaving developers in some countries struggling to realize this dream. India is making a push to overcome the obstacles and develop AI that suits its own needs.\nWe’re thinking: Different countries deserve models that reflect their distinctive characters, but their development efforts need not remain insular. AI is an international project, and teams in different countries benefit by collaborating with one another. Let’s all help one another realize the benefits of AI worldwide.\nGenerated video clips are capturing eyeballs in viral videos, ad campaigns, and a Netflix show.\nWhat’s new: The Dor Brothers, a digital video studio based in Berlin, uses AI-generated clips to produce of social-media hits including “ The Drill ,” which has been viewed 16 million times. Similarly, AI-focused creative agency Genre.ai made a raucous commercial for gaming company Kalshi for less than $2,000, stirring debate about the future of advertising. Netflix generated a scene for one of its streaming productions, the sci-fi series The Eternaut .\nHow it works: For Genre.ai and The Dor Brothers, making stand-out videos requires entering new prompts repeatedly until they’re satisfied with the output, then assembling the best clips using traditional digital video editing tools. For the Kalshi ad, for instance, Genre.ai generated 300 to 400 clips to get 15 keepers. Netflix did not describe its video-generation process.\nThe Dor Brothers begin by brainstorming concepts and feeding them to OpenAI’s ChatGPT and other chatbots to generate prompts. The studio uses Midjourney , Stable Diffusion, and DALL-E to turn prompts into images. It refines the prompts and feeds them to Runway Gen-4 or Google Veo 3, to produce clips.\nGenre.ai CEO PJ Accetturo uses Google Gemini or ChatGPT to help come up with ideas and co-write scripts. He uses Gemini or ChatGPT to convert scripts into shot-by-shot prompts — no more than 5 at a time, which keeps their quality high, he says — then pastes the prompts into Veo 3. To maintain visual consistency, he provides a detailed description of the scene in every prompt.\nNetflix is experimenting with Runway’s models for video generation, Bloomberg reported . To produce the AI-generated clip that appeared in The Eternaut , the company generated a scene in which a building collapsed. AI allowed production to move at 10 times the usual speed and a fraction of the usual cost, Netflix executive Ted Sarandos told The Guardian . Runway’s output has also appeared in scores of music videos, the 2022 movie Everything Everywhere All at Once , and TV’s “The Late Show.”\nBehind the news: Top makers of video generation models have been courting commercial filmmakers to fit generative AI into their production processes.\nRunway has worked with television studio AMC to incorporate its tools into the studio’s production and marketing operations, and with Lionsgate to build a custom model trained on the Hollywood studio’s film archive.\nMeta teamed up with Blumhouse , the production company behind horror thrillers such as Get Out and Halloween , to help develop its Meta Movie Gen tools.\nGoogle’s DeepMind research team helped filmmaker Darren Aronofsky to build an AI-powered movie studio called Primordial Soup .\nWhy it matters: Video generation enables studios to produce finished work on schedules and budgets that would be unattainable any other way. Sets, lighting, cameras, talent, makeup, even scripts and scores — generative AI subsumes them all. For newcomers like The Dor Brothers or Genre.ai, this is liberating. They can focus on realizing their ideas without going to the effort and expense of working with people, video equipment, and locations. For established studios, it’s an opportunity to transform traditional methods and do more with less.\nWe’re thinking: AI is rapidly transforming the labor, cost, and esthetics of filmmaking. This isn’t the first time: It follows close upon streaming and social video, or before that, computer-generated effects and digital cameras. The Screen Actors Guild and Writers Guild of America negotiated agreements with film/video producers that limit some applications of AI, but creative people will find ways to use the technology to make products that audiences like. This creates opportunities for producers not only to boost their productivity but also to expand their revenue — which, we hope, will be used to make more and better productions than ever before.\nA bottleneck in fine-tuning large language models for software engineering is building a dataset that can show them how to edit code, search for subroutines, write test scripts, control a terminal, manage a file system, and so on. Researchers built a pipeline that produces such data automatically.\nWhat’s new: John Yang and colleagues at Stanford, Princeton, and Alibaba introduced SWE-smith , a method that generates realistic examples of bug fixes and other code alterations. The code , dataset , and a model that was fine-tuned on the data are freely available for commercial and noncommercial uses.\nKey insight: Automated unit tests determine whether code does what it’s supposed to do. Code that doesn’t pass a unit test has a bug, so one way to generate bug-fix examples is to start with code that passes a unit test and modify it until it doesn’t. Another is to start with working code and revert to previous versions that contain bugs or lack desired features. Having introduced issues, we can prompt an LLM to eliminate them, producing valid before-and-after examples that don’t require manual validation.\nHow it works: The authors started with 128 GitHub repositories of Python code.\nFor each repository, the authors automatically built a Docker execution environment using SWE-agent , an open-source software engineering agent they built in earlier work.\nThey synthesized bugs via four methods: (i) OpenAI o3-mini introduced bugs into functions or classes, (ii) a custom program altered code procedurally; for example, deleting loops or switching the order of lines, (iii) the authors combined these bugs to create more complex problems, and (iv) they reverted pull requests to re-introduce bugs and remove features from earlier versions of the code.\nThey validated bugs by running unit tests and kept examples in which the buggy code failed one or more tests. To generate examples of multi-step bug fixes, they prompted SWE-agent using Claude 3.5 Sonnet, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, or GPT-4o to fix the bugs over several steps.\nResults: The authors fine-tuned Qwen 2.5 Coder-32B on 5,000 examples, focusing on the bugs produced by methods (i) and (iv) above, which they found most effective. To represent a diversity of bugs, they kept no more than 3 example fixes for any given bug. Paired with SWE-agent, their model solved software engineering problems in SWE-bench Verified in one attempt 40.2 percent of the time. Paired with the OpenHands agentic framework, the same-size R2E-Gym-32B (fine-tuned on different data) and the much bigger Qwen3-235B-A22B (not fine-tuned) solved 34.4 percent in one attempt.\nWhy it matters: Previous datasets for fine-tuning LLMs on coding tasks are small, often comprising thousands of training instances from less than a dozen repositories. The authors’ method can produce such data at scale, potentially enabling major developers to improve their AI-assisted coding models and everyone else to build better systems.\nWe’re thinking: AI-assisted coding is revolutionizing software development, and the tools are still evolving. The ability to produce effective training data at scale is likely to further accelerate the progress — already moving at breakneck speed! — in this area.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 313\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nRecently Meta made headlines with unprecedented, massive compensation packages for AI model builders exceeding $100M (sometimes spread over multiple years). With the company planning to spend $66B-72B this year on capital expenses such as data centers , a meaningful fraction of which will be devoted to AI, from a purely financial point of view, it’s not irrational to spend a few extra billion dollars on salaries to make sure this hardware is used well.\nA typical software-application startup that’s not involved in training foundation models might spend 70-80% of its dollars on salaries, 5-10% on rent, and 10-25% on other operating expenses (cloud hosting, software licenses, marketing, legal/accounting, etc.). But scaling up models is so capital-intensive, salaries are a small fraction of the overall expense. This makes it feasible for businesses in this area to pay their relatively few employees exceptionally well. If you’re spending tens of billions of dollars on GPU hardware, why not spend just a tenth of that on salaries? Even before Meta’s recent offers, salaries of AI model trainers have been high, with many being paid $5-10M/year, although Meta has raised these numbers to new heights.\nMeta carries out many activities, including run Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Oculus. But the Llama/AI-training part of its operations is particularly capital-intensive. Many of Meta’s properties rely on user-generated content (UGC) to attract attention, which is then monetized through advertising. AI is a huge threat and opportunity to such businesses: If AI-generated content (AIGC) substitutes for UGC to capture people's attention to sell ads against, this will transform the social-media landscape.\nThis is why Meta — like TikTok, YouTube, and other social-media properties — is paying close attention to AIGC, and why making significant investments in AI is rational. Further, when Meta hires a key employee, not only does it gain the future work output of that person, but it also potentially gets insight into a competitor’s technology, which also makes its willingness to pay high salaries a rational business move (so long as it does not adversely affect the company’s culture).\nThe pattern of capital-intensive businesses compensating employees extraordinarily well is not new. For example, Netflix expects to spend a huge $18B this year on content. This makes the salary expense of paying its 14,000 employees a small fraction of the total expense, which allows the company to routinely pay above-market salaries. Its ability to spend this way also shapes a distinctive culture that includes elements of “we’re a sports team, not a family” (which seems to work for Netflix but isn’t right for everyone). In contrast, a labor-intensive manufacturing business like Foxconn, which employs over 1 million people globally, has to be much more price-sensitive in what it pays people.\nEven a decade ago, when I led a team that worked to scale up AI, I built spreadsheets that modeled how much of my budget to allocate toward salaries and how much to allocate toward GPUs (using a custom model for how much productive output N employees and M GPUs would lead to, so I could optimize N and M subject to my budget constraint). Since then, the business of scaling up AI has skewed the spending significantly toward GPUs.\nI’m happy for the individuals who are getting large pay packages. And regardless of any individual's pay, I’m grateful for the contributions of everyone working in AI. Everyone in AI deserves a good salary, and while the gaps in compensation are growing, I believe this reflects the broader phenomenon that developers who work in AI, at this moment in history, have an opportunity to make a huge impact and do world-changing work.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nUse the agentic coding assistant Claude Code to build applications faster.

The gpt-oss family comprises two mixture-of-experts (MoE) models, gpt-oss-120b and gpt-oss-20b, that are designed for agentic applications and free to use and modify.\nInput/output: Text in (up to 128,000 tokens), text out (up to 33,000 tokens)\nArchitecture: gpt-oss-120b: MoE transformer, 117 billion parameters total, 5.1 billion parameters active per token; gpt-oss-20b: MoE transformer, 21 billion parameters total, 3.6 billion parameters active per token\nPerformance: Generally ahead of o3-mini, behind o3 and o4-mini\nAvailability: Web demo (free), weights available for commercial and noncommercial use under Apache 2.0 license\nFeatures: adjustable chain-of-thought reasoning levels (high, medium, low), full access to the chain of thought, tool use\nUndisclosed: Details of training data and methods\nHow it works: The team pretrained the gpt-oss models on trillions of tokens of text including general knowledge, coding, math, and science. Fine-tuning focused on reasoning and tool use.\nThe team quantized the weights in MoE layers to use 4.25 bits per parameter. Since 90 percent or more of the parameters fall within MoE layers, this step enables gpt-oss-120b to run on a GPU with 80 gigabytes of memory and gpt-oss-20b to run on a GPU with 16 gigabytes of memory.\nThey fine-tuned the models to generate a chain of thought via supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, a method similar to that used to fine-tune OpenAI o3 .\nDuring fine-tuning, they trained the models to support three reasoning levels by inserting into prompts phrases like “Reasoning:low”.\nSimilarly, they fine-tuned them to search the web, execute Python code, and use arbitrary tools.\nThey also trained the model to refuse requests for hate speech, instructions for committing crimes, recipes for hazardous substances, and the like. In internal tests designed to measure risky behavior, gpt-oss-120b, after being fine-tuned for biology and cybersecurity, fell short of “high capability” in those areas.\nResults: Set to high reasoning effort, the models generally performed midway between o3-mini, o3, and o4-mini in OpenAI’s tests. Unless otherwise noted, OpenAI results come from OpenAI’s reporting , and DeepSeek R1’s results come from its report on its latest update of the model.\nUsing tools to solve competition math problems in AIME 2024, gpt-oss-120b (96.6 percent accuracy) and gpt-oss-20b (96 percent accuracy) exceeded o3 (95.2 percent), but they fell short of o4-mini (98.7 percent).\nAnswering science questions on GPQA Diamond without using tools, gpt-oss-120b (80.1 percent accuracy) outperformed o3-mini (77 percent) but underperformed o3 (83.3 percent) and o4-mini (81.4 percent). The smaller gpt-oss-20b (71.5 percent) came in last among OpenAI models presented. This puts gpt-oss behind Grok 4 (87.7 percent), Gemini 2.5 Pro (84.4 percent), and DeepSeek R1’s latest update (81.3 percent), according to Artificial Analysis.\nOn the retail portion of τ-Bench, a test of agentic tool use, gpt-oss-120b (67.8 percent accuracy) came in above o3 (65.6 percent) and below o4-mini (70.4 percent). These models outperformed DeepSeek R1 (63.9 percent accuracy). In comparison, gpt-oss-20b (54.8 percent accuracy) came in well below.\nBehind the news: Founded in 2015 as a nonprofit corporation, OpenAI initially was devoted to open source development on the theory that AI would produce greater benefits and advance more safely if members of the community at large could inspect, use, and improve upon each others’ work. However, in 2019, the high cost of building cutting-edge AI models led the organization to form a for-profit subsidiary, and it stopped releasing large language model weights (although it continued to publish weights for models such as Clip , which produces similar embeddings for related images and text, and Whisper, a speech-to-text engine).\nWhy it matters: Businesses, developers, and users have a variety of reasons to choose models with open weights, including lower cost, greater control, and the ability to update as they wish. OpenAI’s turn away from open source cleared the way for other teams to capture the market for open offerings. Now it’s returning to a very different landscape. Meta jumped into the breach with its Llama models, along with Allen Institute for AI, Google, and others. Lately, developers in China such as Alibaba ( Qwen3 ), DeepSeek ( DeepSeek-R1 ), Moonshot ( Kimi K2 ), and Z.ai have taken the lead. For developers, the gpt-oss family offers free access to technology designed by an extraordinary team of innovators. For OpenAI, it’s an opportunity to capture the broad range of developers and users that prefer open models to closed ones.\nWe’re thinking: A vibrant open source community is vital to AI’s ongoing progress! Every open model holds valuable knowledge and functionality.\nIn the era of reasoning models, delivering better answers to questions has an environmental cost. A new study quantifies the impact.\nWhat’s new: Researchers estimated the emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases associated with using 14 open-weights large language models. (The information needed to study closed models is not publicly available.) Reasoning, total tokens generated, and accuracy on question-answering benchmarks were associated with higher greenhouse-gas emissions, according to findings by Maximilian Dauner at Munich Center for Digital Sciences and AI and Gudrun Socher at HM Hochschule München University of Applied Sciences.\nHow it works: The authors tested models of various sizes, with and without reasoning capabilities, using questions that required short and long answers.\nThe authors tested Meta’s non-reasoning models Llama 3.1 (8 billion and 70 billion parameters) and Llama 3.3 (70 billion parameters); Alibaba’s non-reasoning models Qwen and Qwen 2.5 (7 billion and 72 billion parameters); Deep Cogito, which has reasoning and non-reasoning modes (8 billion and 70 billion parameters); and the reasoning model DeepSeek-R1 (7 billion, 8 billion, and 70 billion parameters).\nEach model answered 100 MMLU questions about five subjects (philosophy, world history, international law, abstract algebra, and mathematics). The questions took two forms: multiple-choice with single-word answers and prompts that elicited open-ended responses. OpenAI’s o4-mini judged the open-ended responses.\nThe authors ran the models on an Nvidia A100 GPU with 80 gigabytes of memory and measured the amount of energy used by the chip. They multiplied the energy consumption in kilowatt-hours by a global average (480 grams of CO₂-equivalent per kilowatt-hour) to determine the resulting emissions.\nResults: The authors found a clear trade-off between reasoning (and the higher resulting numbers of tokens generated and output accuracy) and greenhouse-gas emissions.\nThe top-performing models achieved around 84 percent to 91 percent accuracy, resulting in around 1,300 grams to 2,000 grams of CO₂-equivalent greenhouse gas emissions per 1,000 questions (500 multiple-choice questions and 500 open-ended questions). By contrast, the smallest model achieved less than 35 percent accuracy and resulted in less than 30 grams of emissions.\nDeep Cogito’s emissions multiplied by 4 to 6 times when reasoning was enabled. For example, the 8 billion-parameter version emitted around 372 grams of emissions with reasoning versus around 56 grams without reasoning.\nOpen-ended responses resulted in still greater emissions. Models generated over 3 times more emissions while answering open-ended questions (an average of 345.55 grams) than they did when answering multiple-choice questions (109.52 grams).\nDeep Cogito with 70 billion parameters bucked the trend. With reasoning enabled, it achieved the highest overall accuracy (84.9 percent) while emitting around 34 percent fewer grams than DeepSeek-R1 with 70 billion parameters (78.9 percent accuracy). This result suggests that energy efficiency can vary dramatically among reasoning models.\nYes, but: The authors’ estimates of carbon emissions likely are overestimates. Older GPUs such as the A100 are less energy-efficient than newer ones; and much cloud computing takes place in data centers powered by renewable energy sources that emit less carbon than global average energy consumption. For example, Google and Amazon match their electricity consumption with renewable energy, and Meta has powered its data centers solely by renewable energy since 2020.\nWhy it matters: The International Energy Agency projects that AI will consume increasing amounts of energy, and thus produce more greenhouse-gas emissions, as companies focus on training and serving ever larger models. Current AI poses a double-barreled challenge: The more accurate a model’s output, (i) the more emissions it will produce and (ii) the more people will query it. Much of the thinking about how to manage this issue has pointed to leaner parameter counts: Smaller models consume less energy. But the authors’ findings instead point to strategic deployment: The right model for the right task. AI providers can reduce emissions by routing inputs to models that can process them both accurately and efficiently, and by limiting outputs to appropriate lengths. These strategies don’t require building new infrastructure or models.\nWe’re thinking: We must continue to work toward improving AI’s energy efficiency and reducing its carbon emissions. That said, in many tasks, using AI produces fewer emissions than other approaches, such as using human labor.\nThe race is on to develop large language models that can drive agentic interactions. Following the one-two punch of Moonshot’s Kimi K2 and Alibaba’s Qwen3-235B-A22B update, China’s Z.ai aims to one-up the competition.\nWhat’s new: GLM-4.5 is a family of open-weights models trained to excel at tool use and coding. The family includes GLM-4.5 and the smaller GLM-4.5-Air, both of which offer reasoning that can be switched on or off.\nInput/output: Text in (up to 128,000 tokens), text out (up to 96,000 tokens)\nArchitecture: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) transformer. GLM-4.5: 355 billion parameters total, 32 billion active at any given time. GLM-4.5-Air: 106 billion parameters total, 12 billion active at any given time.\nPerformance: Both models outperform Anthropic Claude 4 Opus, DeepSeek-R1-0528, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, Grok 4, Kimi K2, and/or OpenAI o3 on at least one reasoning, coding, or agentic benchmark\nAvailability: Web interface (free), API (GLM-4.5: $0.60/$0.11/$2.20 per million input/cached/output tokens; GLM-4.5-Air: $0.20/$0.03/$1.10), weights available via HuggingFace and ModelScope for commercial and noncommercial uses under MIT license\nFeatures: Function calling, switchable reasoning/non-reasoning\nUndisclosed: Specific training datasets\nHow it works: GLM-4.5 models include several architectural features that differ from other recent MoE models. Instead of adding more experts or making the experts use more parameters per layer (which would make the models wider), the team increased the number of layers per expert (which makes them deeper). The pretraining/fine-tuning process distilled three models into one.\nThe team pre-trained the models on 22 trillion tokens: 15 trillion tokens of text followed by 7 trillion tokens of further text devoted to code and reasoning.\nThey fine-tuned three copies of the pretrained GLM-4.5 using supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, producing specialized versions for reasoning, agentic capabilities, and general knowledge. Then they fine-tuned the pretrained model to match the outputs from the specialized versions, producing one model with the capabilities of all three. Finally, they fine-tuned this model via reinforcement learning on further reasoning, agentic, and general data.\nResults: The team compared GLM-4.5 and GLM-4.5-Air to top open and closed models across 12 benchmarks that assess reasoning, coding, and tool use.\nIn an average of tool-use benchmarks (τ-Bench, BFCL v3 Full, ad BrowseComp), GLM-4.5 (90.6 percent accuracy) outperformed Claude Sonnet 4 (89.5 percent accuracy), Kimi K2 (86.2 percent accuracy), and Qwen3-Coder (77.1 percent accuracy). On BrowseComp (web browsing with multi-step searches), GLM-4.5 (26.4 percent accuracy) outperformed Claude 4 Opus (18.8 percent accuracy) but trailed o3 (49.7 percent accuracy).\nOn MATH 500 (selected competition-level problems),GLM-4.5 (98.2 percent accuracy) equalled Claude 4 Opus. On AIME24 (competition math), GLM-4.5 (91.0 percent accuracy) outperformed Claude Opus 4 (75.7 percent accuracy) but trailed Qwen3-235B-Thinking (94.1 percent accuracy).\nOn SWE-bench Verified (software engineering problems), GLM-4.5 (64.2 percent) outperformed Kimi K2 (65.4 percent) but trailed Claude 4 Sonnet (70.4 percent) and Qwen3-Coder (67 percent, tested separately). In Z.ai’s own evaluation across 52 coding tasks, GLM-4.5 achieved an 80.8 percent win rate against Qwen3-Coder and a 53.9 percent win rate against Kimi K2.\nGLM-4.5-Air excelled against likely larger models on multiple benchmarks, For instance, on BFCL v3, GLM-4.5-Air (76.4 percent) outperformed Gemini Pro 2.5 (61.2 percent). On AIME 2024, GLM-4.5-Air (89.4 percent) outperformed Claude 4 Opus (75.7 percent).\nBehind the news: A rapid run of releases by teams in China — Kimi K2, Qwen3’s updates, and now GLM-4.5 — has established momentum in open-weights, large language models that are tuned for agentic behavior.\nWhy it matters: It’s not uncommon to distill larger models into smaller ones, sometimes to shrink the parameter count, sometimes to improve an existing small model’s performance. Z.ai’s approach distilled not a larger model but three specialized variations on the base model.\nWe’re thinking: The “best” open model for agentic applications is shifting weekly, creating both exciting opportunities and daunting challenges for developers.\nAn autonomous robot performed intricate surgical operations without human intervention.\nWhat’s new: Ji Woong (Brian) Kim and colleagues at Johns Hopkins, Stanford, and the surgical technology company Optosurgical developed Hierarchical Surgical Robot Transformer (SRT-H), a system that performs surgery with only routine help from humans. The system, which uses a two-armed surgical robot that ordinarily is operated by hand, successfully completed the key clipping-and-cutting steps to remove gallbladders.\nHow it works: SRT-H pairs two transformer models: a high-level planner that decides what step to take next and a low-level action generator that turns the planner’s decision into signals that control an Intuitive Surgical da Vinci robot. Both models were trained via imitation learning. That is, they learned to map images and text to robot arm motions by copying recorded human demonstrations.\nTo build a training dataset, the team recorded around 17 hours of operations in which humans operated the robot, performing 17 steps to remove gallbladders from 34 pig tissues that had been separated from the animals’ bodies. The recordings captured the outputs of a tube-mounted endoscope, two cameras mounted on the robot’s wrists, and the translations, rotations, and gripper openings of each robot arm.\nAnnotators labeled each step (such as “grab gallbladder” and “place second clip on left tube”) along with corrective instructions wherever the surgeons revised their actions in progress (for instance, “move right arm to the right”). This process resulted in roughly 16,000 labeled, time-stamped, brief sequences of images with corresponding robotics data and natural-language labels.\nGiven the 5 most recent endoscope frames, the high-level transformer learned to predict (i) whether a correction was required (that is, whether the surgeons revised their actions) and, if so, an appropriate natural language instruction for the correction and (ii) an instruction that described the next step in the surgery. A pretrained Swin-T encoded the images, and the transformer’s decoder learned to output the next step, binary correction flag, and corrective instruction.\nGiven the high-level transformer’s correction flag, next-step instruction, and corrective instruction as well as images from the endoscope and wrist cameras, the low-level transformer learned to generate around the next 2 seconds of robot motion. A pretrained EfficientNet-B3 encoded the images, a pretrained DistilBERT embedded the next-step instruction, FiLM layers aligned the embedded instruction with relevant image features, aligning the visual representation with the current instruction. The transformer’s decoder learned to generate the next robot action sequence.\nAt inference, every 3 seconds, the high-level transformer processed the 5 most recent endoscope frames and issued a correction flag, next-step instruction, and corrective instruction. It used the flag to decide which instruction to pass to the low-level transformer. Then the low-level transformer executed actions in chunks, taking roughly 30 time steps for grabbing and 20 time steps for clipping and cutting. It paused automatically for humans to load new clips or swap between cutter and clip applier tools, a role normally assigned to a surgical nurse.\nResults: Tested on 8 pig tissues, SRT-H successfully performed each operation, correcting its own mistakes along the way.\nSRT-H successfully completed all 17 clipping-and-cutting steps on all tissues despite individual variations. When it encountered a problem, it corrected itself and proceeded to complete the operation successfully.\nThe high-level transformer correctly predicted next-step instructions with 97 percent accuracy, correction flags with 95 percent accuracy, and corrective instructions (among 18 possible classes of motion) with 70 percent accuracy.\nIn a preliminary comparison with an expert surgeon, SRT-H moved the robot less and moved it more smoothly than the surgeon did. However, SRT-H was nearly 41 percent slower. (The authors modified SRT-H’s instruments so they would perform clipping and cutting motions without actually clipping or cutting tissue. This enabled the surgeon to operate on the same tissues as the robot.)\nYes, but: The authors tested SRT-H on tissues that had been removed from an animal’s body. Real-world surgery involves the body as a whole, and surgeons must manage bleeding, tissue motion from respiration, and visual occlusions that might challenge SRT-H.\nBehind the news: Prior autonomous surgical systems often rely on custom hardware and setup. For instance, Smart Tissue Autonomous Robot (STAR), which combines model-based planning with a hand-crafted state machine, uses an enhanced endoscope. The instrument integrates near-infrared fluorescence (NIR) and 3D imaging, so the system can be guided by NIR markers on a patient’s tissue and plan sutures on 3D surfaces. By contrast, SRT-H uses the widely deployed da Vinci robot (over 10,000 units in hospitals globally) and learned from RGB video with annotations in natural language — no NIR markers, 3D scanners, or special fixtures.\nWhy it matters: SRT-H is a significant step toward surgeries that can be performed safely by an autonomous robot. There’s still a long way to go: The system performed only portions of gallbladder removals, and it did so on tissues that were outside the body. Nonetheless, it did its job nearly flawlessly. Its natural language interface makes its decisions interpretable and enables humans to override or correct the system using verbal commands, important steps toward safe autonomous surgeries. And since SRT-H relies on imitation learning, presumably it could learn to perform other procedures, given appropriate demonstrations.\nWe’re thinking: In an operating room, the ability to recover from unexpected events trumps perfect execution of predetermined plans. SRT-H’s correction system enables the system to recover from its own mistakes — an important advantage over rigid systems that may work well in the lab but struggle under real-world conditions.\n\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-312/",
        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 312\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nThere is now a path for China to surpass the U.S. in AI. Even though the U.S. is still ahead, China has tremendous momentum with its vibrant open-weights model ecosystem and aggressive moves in semiconductor design and manufacturing. In the startup world, we know momentum matters: Even if a company is small today, a high rate of growth compounded for a few years quickly becomes an unstoppable force. This is why a small, scrappy team with high growth can threaten even behemoths. While both the U.S. and China are behemoths, China’s hypercompetitive business landscape and rapid diffusion of knowledge give it tremendous momentum. The White House’s AI Action Plan released last week, which explicitly champions open source (among other things), is a very positive step for the U.S., but by itself it won’t be sufficient to sustain the U.S. lead.\nNow, AI isn’t a single, monolithic technology, and different countries are ahead in different areas. For example, even before Generative AI, the U.S. had long been ahead in scaled cloud AI implementations, while China has long been ahead in surveillance technology. These translate to different advantages in economic growth as well as both soft and hard power. Even though nontechnical pundits talk about “the race to AGI” as if AGI were a discrete technology to be invented, the reality is that AI technology will progress continuously, and there is no single finish line . If a company or nation declares that it has achieved AGI, I expect that declaration to be less a technology milestone than a marketing milestone. A slight speed advantage in the Olympic 100m dash translates to a dramatic difference between winning a gold medal versus a silver medal. An advantage in AI prowess translates into a proportionate advantage in economic growth and national power; while the impact won’t be a binary one of either winning or losing everything, these advantages nonetheless matter.\nLooking at Artificial Analysis and LMArena leaderboards, the top proprietary models were developed in the U.S., but the top open models come from China. Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI’s o4, Anthropic’s Claude 4 Opus, and Grok 4 are all strong models. But open alternatives from China such as DeepSeek R1-0528, Kimi K2 (designed for agentic reasoning), Qwen3 variations (including Qwen3-Coder, which is strong at coding) and Zhipu’s GLM 4.5 (whose post-training software was released as open source) are close behind, and many are ahead of Google’s Gemma 3 and Meta’s Llama 4 — the U.S.’ best open-weights offerings.\nBecause many U.S. companies have taken a secretive approach to developing foundation models — a reasonable business strategy — the leading companies spend huge numbers of dollars to recruit key team members from each other who might know the “secret sauce“ that enabled a competitor to develop certain capabilities. So knowledge does circulate, but at high cost and slowly. In contrast, in China’s open AI ecosystem, many advanced foundation model companies undercut each other on pricing, make bold PR announcements, and poach each others’ employees and customers. This Darwinian life-or-death struggle will lead to the demise of many of the existing players, but the intense competition breeds strong companies.\nIn semiconductors, too, China is making progress. Huawei’s CloudMatrix 384 aims to compete with Nvidia’s GB200 high-performance computing system. While China has struggled to develop GPUs with a similar capability as Nvidia’s top-of-the-line B200, Huawei is trying to build a competitive system by combining a larger number (384 instead of 72) of lower-capability chips. China’s automotive sector once struggled to compete with U.S. and European internal combustion engine vehicles, but leapfrogged ahead by betting on electric vehicles. It remains to be seen how effective Huawei’s alternative architectures prove to be, but the U.S. export restrictions have given Huawei and other Chinese businesses a strong incentive to invest heavily in developing their own technology. Further, if China were to develop its domestic semiconductor manufacturing capabilities while the U.S. remained reliant on TSMC in Taiwan, then the U.S.’ AI roadmap would be much more vulnerable to a disruption of the Taiwan supply chain (perhaps due to a blockade or, worse, a hot war).\nWith the rise of electricity, the internet, and other general-purpose technologies, there was room for many nations to benefit, and the benefit to one nation hasn’t come at the expense of another. I know of businesses that, many months back, planned for a future in which China dominates open models (indeed, we are there at this moment, although the future depends on our actions). Given the transformative impact of AI, I hope all nations — especially democracies with a strong respect for human rights and the rule of law — will clear roadblocks from AI progress and invest in open science and technology to increase the odds that this technology will support democracy and benefit the greatest possible number of people.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nBuild AI applications that access tools, data, and prompt templates using Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard developed by Anthropic.

Sign up now\nPresident Trump set forth principles of an aggressive national AI policy, and he moved to implement them through an action plan and executive orders.\nWhat’s new: In “ Winning the Race: America’s AI Action Plan ,” the White House outlines a trio of near-term goals for AI in the United States: (i) stimulate innovation, (ii) build infrastructure, and (iii) establish global leadership. As initial steps in these directions, the president directed the federal government to (a) procure only “ideologically neutral” AI models, (b) accelerate permitting of data-center construction, and (c) promote exports of AI technology.\nHow it works: Rather than advocating for legislation or legal challenges, the plan focuses on actions the executive branch of government can take on its own. President Trump had ordered technology advisor Michael Kratsios, AI advisor David Sacks, and national security advisor Marco Rubio to make a plan to “sustain and enhance America’s global AI dominance” within days of starting his current term. Senior policy advisors Dean Ball and Sriram Krishnan, among others, also played key roles.\nStimulate innovation: The plan would support open-source and open-weights software by boosting U.S. developers’ access to processing power and driving adoption of open models by small and medium-size businesses. It calls for the U.S. to build scientific datasets; invest in interpretability, control, robustness, and evaluations; and promote AI in defense applications. In addition, the federal government will support the development of AI skills in its funding of education and workforce training. Moreover, in a speech, Trump said he wants AI companies to be allowed to use copyrighted works freely to train models.\nBuild AI Infrastructure: The plan aims to accelerate the building of data centers, semiconductor manufacturing plants, and energy infrastructure. To this end, the federal government will create exemptions to environmental laws, accelerate approvals, and make federal lands available.\nStrengthen global competitiveness: The plan provides for strengthening AI-related export controls, countering the influence of China, and promoting U.S. values in international agreements regarding sensitive technologies such as face recognition. The federal government will coordinate overseas sales of U.S.-made hardware, models, software tools, applications, and standards. To avoid subjecting U.S. companies to a variety of state laws, it will withhold funding from states that pass AI regulations the administration considers burdensome.\nBehind the news: In contrast to President Trump’s emphasis on U.S. dominance in AI, the previous Biden administration focused on limiting perceived risks.\nIn 2023, the Biden administration issued executive orders that required developers to notify government regulators when they built a model that would pose a risk to national security. It advocated legislation that aimed to protect user privacy and prevent AI from discriminating against protected groups.\nBiden limited exports of U.S. chips and chip-making technology to numerous countries, notably China but also U.S. allies such as India and Singapore. Trump similarly banned chip sales to China, but reversed course in mid-July and pledged to allow Nvidia and AMD to sell advanced chips to China.\nWhy it matters: The Trump administration’s action plan sets the stage for U.S. AI developers to do their best work and share their accomplishments with the world. It aims to avoid the European Union’s risk-averse regulatory approach and counter China’s rising power and influence in AI development. To those ends, it prioritizes a unified national AI policy, streamlines the building of infrastructure, facilitates distributing models and hardware abroad, supports the development of datasets and open-source models, and refrains from defining the arbitrary thresholds of theoretical risk.\nWe’re thinking: This plan is a positive step toward giving the U.S. the infrastructure, global reach, and freedom from bureaucratic burdens that it needs to continue — and possibly accelerate — the rapid pace of innovation. However, the executive order in support of models that are “objective and free from top-down ideological bias” is wrong-headed. The president complains that some AI models are “woke,” and he wants to discourage references to climate change, diversity, and misinformation. But putting those requirements into an executive order, even if it clears some roadblocks to AI development, risks emphasizing some of Trump’s own ideological preferences.\nLess than two weeks after Moonshot’s Kimi K2 bested other open-weights, non-reasoning models in tests related to agentic behavior, Alibaba raised the bar yet again.\nWhat’s new: Alibaba released the weights for three new large language models based on its earlier Qwen3-235B-A22B. It updated the earlier model (designating the update 2507), divided it into non-reasoning and reasoning variants, and added Qwen3-Coder for coding and multi-turn tool use.\nInput/output: Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 and Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507: Text in (up to 262,144 tokens), text out (adjustable, up to 32,768 tokens recommended. Qwen3-Coder: Text in (up to 1 million tokens), text out (adjustable, up to 32,768 tokens recommended).\nArchitecture: Mixture-of-experts transformers. Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 and Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507: 235 billion parameters, 22 billion active at any given time. Qwen3-Coder: 480 billion parameters, 35 billion active at any given time.\nPerformance: Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507: best among non-reasoning models on most benchmarks reported. Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507: middling performance compared to proprietary reasoning models. Qwen3-Coder: best among coding models on most benchmarks reported\nAvailability: Free for noncommercial and commercial uses under Apache 2.0 license via HuggingFace and ModelScope , API access via Alibaba Cloud .\nAPI Price: Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507: $0.70/$2.8 per million input/output tokens. Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507: $0.70/$8.4 per 1 million input/output tokens. Qwen3-Coder: $1 to $6 per 1 million input tokens, $5 to $60 per 1 million output tokens depending on the number of input tokens.\nUndisclosed: Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 and Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507: updated training data and methods. Qwen3-Coder: training data and methods.\nHow it works: The updated Qwen3 models underwent pretraining and reinforcement learning (RL) phases, but the company has not yet published details. During RL, the team used a modified version of Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) that it calls Group Sequence Policy Optimization (GSPO).\nQwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 and Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507: The team removed the switch that previously enabled or disabled reasoning. Instead, users can choose whether to use the nonreasoning or reasoning model. Both models process input sizes up to double that of the previous version.\nQwen3-Coder: The team pretrained Qwen3-Coder on 7.5 trillion tokens, 70 percent of which were code. During RL, Qwen3-Coder learned to solve tasks that required multiple turns of tool use.\nPerformance: The authors compared Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 and Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 to both open and proprietary models across tasks that involved knowledge, reasoning, coding, and tool use. They compared Qwen3-Coder to open and proprietary models on agentic tasks (coding, tool use, and browser use).\nQwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 achieved the best performance on 14 of 25 benchmarks tested compared to other non-reasoning models, including Kimi K2 , Claude Opus 4 (with reasoning mode turned off), and GPT-4o. It did especially well on knowledge and reasoning tasks. For example, on GPQA (graduate-level science questions), Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507 (77.5 percent accuracy) outperformed second-best Kimi K2 (75.1 percent accuracy).\nQwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 achieved the best performance on 7 of 23 benchmarks compared to other reasoning models, often behind o3 and Gemini-2.5 Pro and ahead of Claud 4 Opus with thinking mode turned on. For instance, on GPQA, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Thinking-2507 (81.1 percent accuracy) fell behind Gemini 2.5 Pro (86.4 percent) and o3 (83.3 percent) but ahead of Claude 4 Opus (79.6 percent).\nQwen3-Coder outperformed open-weights models Kimi K2 Instruct and DeepSeek-V3 on all 13 benchmarks presented that involve agentic capabilities like multi-turn coding and agentic workflows. Compared to Claude 4 Sonnet, it achieved better performance on 6 of 13. For instance, on SWE-bench Verified (software engineering tasks), the authors compared the models using the OpenHands agentic framework for 100 turns. Qwen3-Coder succeeded 67 percent of the time, while Kimi K2 Instruct succeeded 65.4 percent of the time and Claude Sonnet 4 succeeded 68 percent of the time.\nWhy it matters: Developers of open-weights models are adjusting their approaches to emphasize performance in agentic tasks (primarily involving coding and tool use). These models open doors to a vast range of applications that, given a task, can plan an appropriate series of actions and interact with other computer systems to execute them. That the first wave of such models were built by teams in China is significant: U.S. developers like Anthropic, Google, and OpenAI continue to lead the way with proprietary models, but China’s open-weights community is hot on their heels, while the U.S. open-weights champion, Meta, may step away from this role.\nWe’re thinking: Agentic performance is driving the next wave of AI progress. We hope to learn more about how the Qwen team raised the bar.\nNvidia will resume sales of H20 processors in China.\nWhat’s new: Nvidia and AMD said they’ll resume supplying to China graphics processing units (GPUs) tailored to comply with U.S. export restrictions, including Nvidia’s H20 and AMD’s MI308, after the Trump administration, which had blocked the sales, assured the companies it now would allow them.\nHow it works: In April, the White House announced that shipments to China of Nvidia H20s, AMD MI308s, and equivalent chips would require export licenses, which apparently would not be forthcoming. That requirement effectively shut both companies out of China, which in 2024 accounted for 13 percent of Nvidia’s revenue and 24 percent of AMD’s. The White House’s decision to grant the licenses follows months of lobbying by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang.\nHuang met with Trump in the Oval Office, built relationships with key White House officials, and attended a $1-million-a-seat dinner for a chance to speak with the president, The New York Times reported .\nHuang told Trump the H20 was inferior to the company’s top-of-the-line processors. He argued that the bans prevented U.S. chipmakers from competing in a critical market and assisted Chinese competitors by shutting out Nvidia, which sells more than 90 percent of GPUs globally. In addition, he agreed to spend $500 billion to fabricate GPUs in the U.S. rather than Taiwan, where they are currently manufactured.\nThe White House said it relaxed restrictions on chip sales to China in part because China eased limits on shipments of rare-earth permanent magnets, which are critical to defense, automotive, and technology companies, to the U.S.\nNvidia told customers in China that it would initially struggle to meet demand for the H20 due to limited supply, The Information reported .\nBehind the news: U.S. lawmakers of both major parties aim to protect U.S. economic interests and prevent China from using advanced chip technology for military applications.\nIn 2022, the Biden administration restricted exports to China of some advanced AI chips. Exports were tightened further in 2023, 2024, and by President Trump this year.\nNvidia designed the H20 to comply with the Biden-era restrictions. Launched in 2024, the H20 provides 28 percent less processing power than the H100, Nvidia’s top of the line at the time, but more memory and memory bandwidth. The balance between downgrade and upgrade has led some analysts to question whether the H20 is actually hobbled for many purposes.\nThe restrictions have met with mixed results. Chinese companies have acquired top-of-the-line chips on the black market or paid for cloud-computing access to chips located in countries where they’re available without violating U.S. export controls.\nWhy it matters: AI presents geopolitical opportunities for technological and economic dominance as well as challenges to military power. The U.S. export restrictions are intended to balance these elements, yet they have been largely ineffective so far. This year, DeepSeek developed DeepSeek-R1, which delivers high performance for a low development cost. H20s were among the hardware used to train that model, TechCrunch reported . Alibaba , Moonshot, Tencent, and other Chinese companies also have produced high-performance foundation models, while China has accelerated its own semiconductor industry to avoid relying on US suppliers. Relaxing the restrictions may balance U.S. interests more effectively.\nWe’re thinking: Ensuring national security is crucial, but so is enabling the free flow of ideas and innovation. We applaud the relaxation of trade restrictions and look forward to further contributions by developers in China and around the world.\nPeople who turn to chatbots for companionship show indications of lower self-reported well-being, researchers found.\nWhat’s new: Yutong Zhang, Dora Zhao, Jeffrey T. Hancock, and colleagues at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon examined correlations between users’ chatbot usage and psychological health. The more frequently users chatted, shared personal information, and went without human social relationships, the lower they rated their own well-being, the authors found.\nKey insight: Chatbot users may not report the subject matter of their conversations accurately, but LLMs can identify and summarize topics in chat histories. This makes it possible to correlate the intensity and depth of chats with self-reported measures of well-being, such as loneliness and satisfaction.\nHow it works: The authors surveyed 1,131 users of the chatbot service Character.AI, which provides chatbots for purposes like roleplay, conversation, and education. In addition, they gathered 413,509 messages from 4,363 conversations with 244 participants who agreed to share their chat logs.\nThe authors gauged the users’ stated motivations for using chatbots versus their likely motivations. They asked the users to select one of the following motivations: productivity, curiosity, entertainment, or companionship. They also asked them to describe freely why they used Character.AI. GPT-4o classified the descriptions of chatbot usage according to the four categories of motivation, giving the authors a more nuanced view.\nThey surveyed users to measure the intensity of their chatbot interactions, including how many chatbots they conversed with, how long they conversed, and how comfortable they felt disclosing sensitive personal information.\nThey also surveyed users to measure their human social support, including how many close relationships they had with friends and relatives.\nFinally, they asked questions to measure the users’ well-being based on six factors: satisfaction, loneliness, sense of belonging, positive and negative emotions, and perceived social support.\nLLaMA-3-70B summarized conversations and fed the summaries to TopicGPT , which identified recurring themes.\nResults: The authors computed correlations among the various signals and the six measures of well-being. They found that most users turned to chatbots for companionship, whether or not they selected companionship as a motivation for their chats. Furthermore, reliance on chatbots for companionship indicated lower well-being.\n12 percent of users surveyed selected companionship as their primary reason for using Character.AI, but 51 percent described their chatbot as a friend, companion, or romantic partner. The chat logs showed much higher use of chatbots as companions: 93 percent of users had at least one conversation that showed companion-like engagement, 80 percent of chat sessions involved emotional and social support, and 68 percent involved romantic or intimate roleplay.\nGreater use of chatbots for companionship correlated with lower apparent well-being. This effect was strongest when companionship was the main reason given in the multiple-choice survey (-0.47 correlation with lower well-being, where -1 indicates the greatest correlation, 0 indicates no correlation, and 1 indicates the highest correlation with greater well-being).\nYes, but: The authors found a consistent correlation between chatbot companionship and lower well-being, but they didn’t establish causation. The data shows that people who sought companionship from chatbots likely struggled with loneliness or a lack of close social connections. It remains unclear whether loneliness caused the users to use chatbots for companionship or vice-versa, or whether using chatbots relieved or exacerbated their loneliness.\nBehind the news: AI companions have been shown to bring both benefit and harm. Some studies report short-term benefits like reduced loneliness and emotional relief . Users say chatbots are nonjudgmental and easy to talk to. But other work has found emotional overdependence, distorted relationship expectations, and harmful behavior encouraged by unmoderated bots.\nWhy it matters: Increasingly, people converse with chatbots as an alternative to human conversation. Chatbot builders must be aware of the potential pitfalls of using their products and conduct research sufficient to enable them to build more beneficial bots. Of course, society also has a role to play by fostering social support through access to community, care infrastructure, and mental-health services.\nWe’re thinking: Whether it’s beneficial or not, developers are building chatbots that aim to form relationships with people. Such relationships appear to fulfill many of the same needs as human relationships, and they do so in ways that many people, for a wide variety of reasons, find more practical or comfortable. Some developers may be tempted to exploit such needs for profit, but we urge them to design apps that focus on strengthening human-to-human relationships.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 311\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nWe’re organizing a new event called Buildathon: The Rapid Engineering Competition, to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area on Saturday, August 16, 2025! You can learn more and apply to participate here .\nAI-assisted coding is speeding up software engineering more than most people appreciate.  We’re inviting the best builders from Silicon Valley and around the world to compete in person on rapidly engineering software.\nI’ve observed a wide spectrum of AI adoption among software engineers. Some use AI only occasionally — for example, asking LLMs basic coding questions. Others have integrated AI-assisted IDEs like Cursor or Windsurf into their daily work. More advanced users are skilled at directing agentic coding assistants such as Claude Code and Gemini CLI. A small but growing group is now orchestrating multiple AI agents working in parallel across different parts of a large codebase.\nIn tech, the desire to chase the latest shiny technology sometimes leads individuals and even businesses to switch tooling more often than necessary. But the rapid evolution of AI coding tools means teams that are half a generation behind can be significantly less productive than those at the bleeding edge.\nCode autocompletion by GitHub Copilot was cutting-edge 2 years ago, but it’s nowhere near what is possible now! For example, my team AI Fund routinely goes from a product idea to a basic working product or prototype in hours. This is why overcoming the Product Management Bottleneck — deciding what to build rather than the actual building — occupies a growing part of our effort.\nDeepLearning.AI and AI Fund are organizing this Buildathon competition to see how quickly the best developers can build products. We’ll provide a loose product spec, say on a Real-Time Multiplayer Code Editor or Personal Finance Tracker (see above). Historically, these products may have taken a team of 2 or 3 engineers weeks or months to build. But we hope participants will be able to build them in closer to 60 minutes. You can read more about the competition format here.\nIf you use AI-assisted coding to engineer software quickly, please join our Buildathon here and show us your skills!\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn our course Retrieval Augmented Generation , you’ll build RAG systems that connect AI models to trusted, external data sources. This hands-on course covers techniques for retrieval, prompting, and evaluation to improve the quality of your applications’ output. Get started now\nA $3 billion bid by OpenAI to acquire Windsurf, maker of the AI-assisted integrated development environment of the same name, collapsed at the 11th hour, setting off a tumultuous few days of corporate maneuvering.\nWhat’s new: Google licensed Windsurf’s technology for $2.4 billion and hired CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and an unknown number of key engineers. Cognition AI, maker of the Devin agentic coding system, purchased what remained for an undisclosed sum. OpenAI was left empty-handed.\nHow it works: AI-assisted coding tools are boosting software engineering productivity, accelerating development cycles, and finding bugs and security vulnerabilities. As a leader in the field, Windsurf became a target for acquisition.\nIn early May, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI had agreed to pay $3 billion for Windsurf, formerly known as Codeium. The deal would have given OpenAI talent, technology, and a user base to compete in AI-assisted coding.\nThe same day, Windsurf CEO Mohan posted on the social media platform X, “Big announcement tomorrow!” But the day came and went with no further news.\nOn July 11, Bloomberg reported that the deal was off. Instead, Mohan and the others had accepted positions at Google as part of a $2.4 billion non-exclusive deal to license Windsurf’s technology. OpenAI’s effort had unraveled partly because Microsoft, due to its relationship with OpenAI, would have gained access to Windsurf’s intellectual property.\nThree days later, Cognition announced that it had acquired Windsurf’s remaining assets. Windsurf promoted head of business Jeff Wang to CEO. The company awarded equity to all employees and accelerated the schedule for equity to vest.\nBehind the news: Google’s hiring of Windsurf’s leadership and access to its technology in return for a large licensing fee mirrors its earlier arrangement with Character.AI . Such deals between AI leaders and startups have become increasingly common as AI companies seek quick advantages without the risk that regulators might delay or quash an outright acquisition, while AI startups seek infusions of cash to support the building of cutting-edge models. Other deals of this sort have involved Meta and Scale AI , Amazon and Adept , and Microsoft and Inflection .\nWhy it matters: AI-assisted coding is hot! Google recently launched Gemini Code Assist and Gemini CLI, competing with Amazon Kiro, Anthropic Claude Code, Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot , Replit Ghostwriter, and others. Expertise and technology from Windsurf may help it pull ahead. Meanwhile, Cognition’s 2024 release of Devin pioneered agentic coding, but since then competitors have taken the spotlight. Cash from Google gives the company a chance to regroup. As for OpenAI, there are other great makers of AI-assisted tools to negotiate with.\nWe’re thinking: Windsurf’s Anshul Ramachandran teaches a short course on agentic coding. Check it out for a peek at the technology Google deemed worth $2.4 billion.\nAn agent’s performance depends not only on an effective workflow but also on a large language model that excels at agentic activities. A new open-weights model focuses on those capabilities.\nWhat’s new: Beijing-based Moonshot AI released the Kimi K2 family of 1 trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs). The family includes the pretrained Kimi-K2-Base and Kimi-K2-Instruct, which is fine-tuned for core agentic tasks, notably tool use. Bucking the recent trend in LLMs, Kimi K2 models are not trained for chain-of-thought reasoning.\nInput/output: Text in (up to around 128,000 tokens), text out (up to around 16,000 tokens)\nArchitecture: Mixture-of-experts transformer, 1 trillion parameters total, 32 billion parameters active\nPerformance: Outperforms other open-weights, non-reasoning models in tool use, coding, math, and general-knowledge benchmarks\nAvailability: Web interface (free), API ($0.60/$0.15/$2.50 per million input/cached/output tokens), weights available for non-commercial and commercial uses up to 100 million monthly active users or monthly revenue of $20,000,000 under “ modified MIT license ”\nFeatures: Tool use including web search and arbitrary tools\nUndisclosed: Specific training methods, training datasets\nHow it works: Moonshot pretrained the models on 15.5 trillion tokens from undisclosed sources. It fine-tuned Kimi-K2-Instruct via reinforcement learning using a proprietary dataset.\nTo enable Kimi-K2-Instruct to use tools, the team generated a large dataset of examples in which models used tools, both real-world and synthetic, that implement model context protocol ( MCP ). Unidentified models acted as users, and other unidentified models acted as agents that solved tasks assigned by the users.  A further model acted as a judge to filter out unsuccessful examples.\nThe team fine-tuned Kimi-K2-Instruct via reinforcement learning. The model evaluated its own performance, used its evaluation as a reward, and iteratively improved its performance.\nThe team also fine-tuned Kimi-K2-Instruct to solve coding and math problems via reinforcement learning. The model did not evaluate its own performance on these problems; it determined rewards according to pre-existing solutions or unit tests.\nResults: Moonshot compared Kimi-K2-Instruct to two open-weights, non-reasoning models (DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B with reasoning switched off) and four closed, non-reasoning models.\nKimi-K2-Instruct outperformed the open-weights models across a range of benchmarks for tool use, coding, math, reasoning, and general knowledge.\nIt achieved middling performance relative to the closed models, though it did relatively well in math and science tasks.\nCompared to all models tested, on LiveCodeBench (coding tasks), Kimi K2 (53 percent) achieved the best performance, ahead of Claude Sonnet 4 with extended thinking mode switched off (48.5 percent).\nAmong all models tested, on AceBench (tool use), Kimi K2 (76.5 percent accuracy) placed second behind GPT 4.1 (80.1 percent accuracy).\nOn 8 out of 11 math and science benchmarks, Kimi K2 achieved the best performance of all models tested.\nBehind the news: Third-party vendors have been quick to implement Kimi-K2-Instruct.\nThe Groq platform accelerates Kimi-K2-Instruct’s output to about 200 tokens per second ($1/$3 per million input/output tokens) compared to 45 tokens per second reported by Artificial Analysis.\nThe fine-tuning platform Unsloth released quantized versions that run on local devices that have 250 gigabytes of combined hard-disk capacity, RAM, and VRAM.\nWhy it matters: Demand is growing for LLMs that carry out agentic workflows accurately, as these workflows lead to better performance. Kimi-K2-Instruct gives developers a strong option for fine-tuning models for their own agentic tasks.\nWe’re thinking: Early LLMs were built to generate output for human consumption. But the rise of agentic workflows means that more and more LLM output is consumed by computers, so it makes good sense to put more research and training effort into building LLMs that generate output for computers. A leading LLM optimized for agentic workflows is a boon to developers!\nThe European Union published guidelines to help builders of AI models to comply with the AI Act, which was enacted last year.\nWhat’s new: The General Purpose AI Code of Practice outlines voluntary procedures to comply with provisions of the AI Act that govern general-purpose models. Companies that follow the guidelines will benefit from simplified compliance, greater legal certainty, and potentially lower administrative costs, according to EU officials. Those that don’t must comply with the law nonetheless, which may prove more costly. While Microsoft, Mistral, and OpenAI said they would follow the guidelines, Meta declined , saying that Europe is “heading down the wrong path on AI.”\nHow it works: The code focuses on “general-purpose AI models” that are capable of performing a wide range of tasks.\nStricter rules apply to models that are deemed to pose “systemic risk,” or “a risk that is specific to the high-impact capabilities” owing to a model’s reach or clear potential for producing negative effects. Managers of such models must perform continuous assessment and mitigation, including identifying and analyzing systemic risks and evaluating how acceptable they are. They must protect against unauthorized access and insider threats.\nDevelopers who build models that pose systemic risk must maintain a variety of documentation. They must disclose training data and sources, how they obtained rights to the data, the resulting model’s properties, their testing methods, and computational resources and energy consumed. They must file updates when they make significant changes or upon request of parties that use the model. They must report mishaps and model misbehavior. They must file a report within 2 days of becoming aware of an event that led to a serious and irreversible disruption of critical infrastructure, 5 days to report a cybersecurity breach, and 10 days a model’s responsibility for a human death.\nThe code doesn’t mention penalties for noncompliance or violations. Further, the code doesn’t discuss the cost of compliance except to say that assessing and mitigating systemic risks “merits significant investment of time and resources.” In 2024, Germany’s Federal Statistical Office estimated that the cost of compliance for a high-risk system would come to roughly $600,000 to get started and another $100,000 annually.\nBehind the news: The AI Act is the product of years of debate and lobbying among scores of stakeholders. EU technology official Henna Virkkunen called the AI Act “an important step” in making cutting-edge models “not only innovative but also safe and transparent.” However, companies and governments on both sides of the Atlantic have asserted that the law goes too far. In May, the EU moved to relax some provisions, including language that would allow users to sue AI companies for damages caused by their systems. Earlier this month, 44 chief executives at top European companies asked European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to postpone the AI Act’s rules that govern general-purpose models for two years.\nWhy it matters: The AI Act is the most comprehensive and far-reaching set of AI regulations enacted to date, yet it remains highly contentious and in flux. The commitments by Microsoft, Mistral, and OpenAI to follow the code mark a significant step in the act’s circuitous path to implementation, but also an increase in bureaucracy and potential for regulatory capture. Their endorsement could persuade other big companies to sign on and weaken further efforts to loosen the act’s requirements.\nWe’re thinking: From a regulatory point of view, the notion of systemic risk is misguided. Limiting the inherent risk of AI models is as helpful as limiting the inherent risk of electric motors, which would result only in relatively useless motors. We hope for further revisions in the AI Act that relieve burdens on builders of foundation models, especially open source projects, and address practical risks of specific applications rather than theoretical risks of their underlying technology .\nLLMs can struggle with difficult algorithmic or scientific challenges when asked to solve them in a single attempt. An agentic workflow improved one-shot performance on hard problems both theoretical and practical.\nWhat’s new: Alexander Novikov, Ngân Vũ, Marvin Eisenberger, and colleagues at Google built AlphaEvolve , an agentic system that used LLMs to generate code in an evolutionary process. AlphaEvolve solved longstanding math problems and helped to reduce the training time for one of Google’s Gemini large language models.\nKey insight: When we’re using an LLM to solve a difficult problem, it’s often more effective to start with a working version and gradually improve it than to generate a solution in one shot. By making small, targeted modifications and keeping only those that perform best under automated evaluation, this iterative process can solve problems that LLMs often can’t solve directly. Google used this idea in its earlier FunSearch , which used an LLM to evolve individual Python functions. This approach has become more powerful as LLMs have improved, and today it can benefit more difficult problems.\nHow it works: AlphaEvolve implemented an evolutionary loop: Given initial code and evaluation code, Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini 2.0 Pro suggested changes, stored the revised program in a database, evaluated it, suggested further changes, and repeated the process.\nThe initial code was required to run but it could be minimal, a skeleton with placeholder logic like functions that return constants (such as “def custom_sort(list): return 2”), which primed AlphaEvolve to find a custom sorting function). Special tags indicated which parts AlphaEvolve could improve (for example, “return 2” only).\nThe evaluation code could use the usual Python “sorted” function to check for correctness (for instance, “def evaluate(): return custom_sort(lst) == sorted(lst)”).\nAlphaEvolve prompted Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro to improve the code; for example, “Act as an expert software developer. Your task is to iteratively improve the provided codebase. [USER PROVIDED CODE]”. Gemini 2.0 Flash generated ideas quickly,  while Gemini 2.0 Pro provided slower but higher-quality suggestions. Each LLM proposed small alterations.\nAlphaEvolve ran and scored the altered code using the evaluation code. AlphaEvolve updated a database with the new alterations and their scores.\nThe system continued in loop: It sampled high-scoring programs from its database to include in the prompts for the two LLMs, which suggested further alterations. Then it evaluated the altered programs, stored them in the database, and so on. (The authors don’t explain how the loop ends.)\nResults: AlphaEvolve achieved breakthroughs in both math and software engineering.\nAlphaEvolve discovered a new algorithm for multiplying 4×4 matrices of complex values that uses 48 multiplications, fewer than [Strassen’s method], the first such progress in 56 years. (Prior work by Google improved Strassen’s method for 4×4 matrices of binary values.)\nThe authors used the system to tackle over 50 other math problems. It matched the performance of the best-known algorithms in about 75 percent of cases and surpassed them in 20 percent, for instance the kissing number problem (packing spheres in 11-dimensional space so they all touch the same sphere).\nIn software engineering, it optimized key components of Google's infrastructure. (i) It improved Google’s cluster scheduling algorithms, freeing up 0.7 percent of total computing resources that otherwise would be idle. (ii) It also discovered a GPU kernel configuration that accelerated attention by 32 percent. (iii) It found ways to split up the matrices that delivered an average 23 percent speedup for matrix multiplication relative to previous expert-designed heuristics. This reduced Gemini’s training time by 1 percent.\nWhy it matters: AlphaEvolve proposes thousands of candidate ideas — some bad, some brilliant — to evolve better programs. The authors show that this approach can improve algorithms that have stood for decades as well as computing infrastructure designed by Google engineers. Thus, AlphaEvolve adds to the growing evidence that LLMs can act as collaborators in cutting-edge research, exploring broad problem spaces and finding novel solutions. Other examples include Co-Scientis t and SWE-agent .\nWe’re thinking: Relatively simple evaluations enabled the authors’ agentic evolutionary system to gradually improve. More broadly, evaluations are proving to be important to a wide variety of agentic workflows.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 311\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nWe’re organizing a new event called Buildathon: The Rapid Engineering Competition, to be held in the San Francisco Bay Area on Saturday, August 16, 2025! You can learn more and apply to participate here .\nAI-assisted coding is speeding up software engineering more than most people appreciate.  We’re inviting the best builders from Silicon Valley and around the world to compete in person on rapidly engineering software.\nI’ve observed a wide spectrum of AI adoption among software engineers. Some use AI only occasionally — for example, asking LLMs basic coding questions. Others have integrated AI-assisted IDEs like Cursor or Windsurf into their daily work. More advanced users are skilled at directing agentic coding assistants such as Claude Code and Gemini CLI. A small but growing group is now orchestrating multiple AI agents working in parallel across different parts of a large codebase.\nIn tech, the desire to chase the latest shiny technology sometimes leads individuals and even businesses to switch tooling more often than necessary. But the rapid evolution of AI coding tools means teams that are half a generation behind can be significantly less productive than those at the bleeding edge.\nCode autocompletion by GitHub Copilot was cutting-edge 2 years ago, but it’s nowhere near what is possible now! For example, my team AI Fund routinely goes from a product idea to a basic working product or prototype in hours. This is why overcoming the Product Management Bottleneck — deciding what to build rather than the actual building — occupies a growing part of our effort.\nDeepLearning.AI and AI Fund are organizing this Buildathon competition to see how quickly the best developers can build products. We’ll provide a loose product spec, say on a Real-Time Multiplayer Code Editor or Personal Finance Tracker (see above). Historically, these products may have taken a team of 2 or 3 engineers weeks or months to build. But we hope participants will be able to build them in closer to 60 minutes. You can read more about the competition format here.\nIf you use AI-assisted coding to engineer software quickly, please join our Buildathon here and show us your skills!\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn our course Retrieval Augmented Generation , you’ll build RAG systems that connect AI models to trusted, external data sources. This hands-on course covers techniques for retrieval, prompting, and evaluation to improve the quality of your applications’ output. Get started now\nA $3 billion bid by OpenAI to acquire Windsurf, maker of the AI-assisted integrated development environment of the same name, collapsed at the 11th hour, setting off a tumultuous few days of corporate maneuvering.\nWhat’s new: Google licensed Windsurf’s technology for $2.4 billion and hired CEO Varun Mohan, co-founder Douglas Chen, and an unknown number of key engineers. Cognition AI, maker of the Devin agentic coding system, purchased what remained for an undisclosed sum. OpenAI was left empty-handed.\nHow it works: AI-assisted coding tools are boosting software engineering productivity, accelerating development cycles, and finding bugs and security vulnerabilities. As a leader in the field, Windsurf became a target for acquisition.\nIn early May, Bloomberg reported that OpenAI had agreed to pay $3 billion for Windsurf, formerly known as Codeium. The deal would have given OpenAI talent, technology, and a user base to compete in AI-assisted coding.\nThe same day, Windsurf CEO Mohan posted on the social media platform X, “Big announcement tomorrow!” But the day came and went with no further news.\nOn July 11, Bloomberg reported that the deal was off. Instead, Mohan and the others had accepted positions at Google as part of a $2.4 billion non-exclusive deal to license Windsurf’s technology. OpenAI’s effort had unraveled partly because Microsoft, due to its relationship with OpenAI, would have gained access to Windsurf’s intellectual property.\nThree days later, Cognition announced that it had acquired Windsurf’s remaining assets. Windsurf promoted head of business Jeff Wang to CEO. The company awarded equity to all employees and accelerated the schedule for equity to vest.\nBehind the news: Google’s hiring of Windsurf’s leadership and access to its technology in return for a large licensing fee mirrors its earlier arrangement with Character.AI . Such deals between AI leaders and startups have become increasingly common as AI companies seek quick advantages without the risk that regulators might delay or quash an outright acquisition, while AI startups seek infusions of cash to support the building of cutting-edge models. Other deals of this sort have involved Meta and Scale AI , Amazon and Adept , and Microsoft and Inflection .\nWhy it matters: AI-assisted coding is hot! Google recently launched Gemini Code Assist and Gemini CLI, competing with Amazon Kiro, Anthropic Claude Code, Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot , Replit Ghostwriter, and others. Expertise and technology from Windsurf may help it pull ahead. Meanwhile, Cognition’s 2024 release of Devin pioneered agentic coding, but since then competitors have taken the spotlight. Cash from Google gives the company a chance to regroup. As for OpenAI, there are other great makers of AI-assisted tools to negotiate with.\nWe’re thinking: Windsurf’s Anshul Ramachandran teaches a short course on agentic coding. Check it out for a peek at the technology Google deemed worth $2.4 billion.\nAn agent’s performance depends not only on an effective workflow but also on a large language model that excels at agentic activities. A new open-weights model focuses on those capabilities.\nWhat’s new: Beijing-based Moonshot AI released the Kimi K2 family of 1 trillion-parameter large language models (LLMs). The family includes the pretrained Kimi-K2-Base and Kimi-K2-Instruct, which is fine-tuned for core agentic tasks, notably tool use. Bucking the recent trend in LLMs, Kimi K2 models are not trained for chain-of-thought reasoning.\nInput/output: Text in (up to around 128,000 tokens), text out (up to around 16,000 tokens)\nArchitecture: Mixture-of-experts transformer, 1 trillion parameters total, 32 billion parameters active\nPerformance: Outperforms other open-weights, non-reasoning models in tool use, coding, math, and general-knowledge benchmarks\nAvailability: Web interface (free), API ($0.60/$0.15/$2.50 per million input/cached/output tokens), weights available for non-commercial and commercial uses up to 100 million monthly active users or monthly revenue of $20,000,000 under “ modified MIT license ”\nFeatures: Tool use including web search and arbitrary tools\nUndisclosed: Specific training methods, training datasets\nHow it works: Moonshot pretrained the models on 15.5 trillion tokens from undisclosed sources. It fine-tuned Kimi-K2-Instruct via reinforcement learning using a proprietary dataset.\nTo enable Kimi-K2-Instruct to use tools, the team generated a large dataset of examples in which models used tools, both real-world and synthetic, that implement model context protocol ( MCP ). Unidentified models acted as users, and other unidentified models acted as agents that solved tasks assigned by the users.  A further model acted as a judge to filter out unsuccessful examples.\nThe team fine-tuned Kimi-K2-Instruct via reinforcement learning. The model evaluated its own performance, used its evaluation as a reward, and iteratively improved its performance.\nThe team also fine-tuned Kimi-K2-Instruct to solve coding and math problems via reinforcement learning. The model did not evaluate its own performance on these problems; it determined rewards according to pre-existing solutions or unit tests.\nResults: Moonshot compared Kimi-K2-Instruct to two open-weights, non-reasoning models (DeepSeek-V3 and Qwen3-235B-A22B with reasoning switched off) and four closed, non-reasoning models.\nKimi-K2-Instruct outperformed the open-weights models across a range of benchmarks for tool use, coding, math, reasoning, and general knowledge.\nIt achieved middling performance relative to the closed models, though it did relatively well in math and science tasks.\nCompared to all models tested, on LiveCodeBench (coding tasks), Kimi K2 (53 percent) achieved the best performance, ahead of Claude Sonnet 4 with extended thinking mode switched off (48.5 percent).\nAmong all models tested, on AceBench (tool use), Kimi K2 (76.5 percent accuracy) placed second behind GPT 4.1 (80.1 percent accuracy).\nOn 8 out of 11 math and science benchmarks, Kimi K2 achieved the best performance of all models tested.\nBehind the news: Third-party vendors have been quick to implement Kimi-K2-Instruct.\nThe Groq platform accelerates Kimi-K2-Instruct’s output to about 200 tokens per second ($1/$3 per million input/output tokens) compared to 45 tokens per second reported by Artificial Analysis.\nThe fine-tuning platform Unsloth released quantized versions that run on local devices that have 250 gigabytes of combined hard-disk capacity, RAM, and VRAM.\nWhy it matters: Demand is growing for LLMs that carry out agentic workflows accurately, as these workflows lead to better performance. Kimi-K2-Instruct gives developers a strong option for fine-tuning models for their own agentic tasks.\nWe’re thinking: Early LLMs were built to generate output for human consumption. But the rise of agentic workflows means that more and more LLM output is consumed by computers, so it makes good sense to put more research and training effort into building LLMs that generate output for computers. A leading LLM optimized for agentic workflows is a boon to developers!\nThe European Union published guidelines to help builders of AI models to comply with the AI Act, which was enacted last year.\nWhat’s new: The General Purpose AI Code of Practice outlines voluntary procedures to comply with provisions of the AI Act that govern general-purpose models. Companies that follow the guidelines will benefit from simplified compliance, greater legal certainty, and potentially lower administrative costs, according to EU officials. Those that don’t must comply with the law nonetheless, which may prove more costly. While Microsoft, Mistral, and OpenAI said they would follow the guidelines, Meta declined , saying that Europe is “heading down the wrong path on AI.”\nHow it works: The code focuses on “general-purpose AI models” that are capable of performing a wide range of tasks.\nStricter rules apply to models that are deemed to pose “systemic risk,” or “a risk that is specific to the high-impact capabilities” owing to a model’s reach or clear potential for producing negative effects. Managers of such models must perform continuous assessment and mitigation, including identifying and analyzing systemic risks and evaluating how acceptable they are. They must protect against unauthorized access and insider threats.\nDevelopers who build models that pose systemic risk must maintain a variety of documentation. They must disclose training data and sources, how they obtained rights to the data, the resulting model’s properties, their testing methods, and computational resources and energy consumed. They must file updates when they make significant changes or upon request of parties that use the model. They must report mishaps and model misbehavior. They must file a report within 2 days of becoming aware of an event that led to a serious and irreversible disruption of critical infrastructure, 5 days to report a cybersecurity breach, and 10 days a model’s responsibility for a human death.\nThe code doesn’t mention penalties for noncompliance or violations. Further, the code doesn’t discuss the cost of compliance except to say that assessing and mitigating systemic risks “merits significant investment of time and resources.” In 2024, Germany’s Federal Statistical Office estimated that the cost of compliance for a high-risk system would come to roughly $600,000 to get started and another $100,000 annually.\nBehind the news: The AI Act is the product of years of debate and lobbying among scores of stakeholders. EU technology official Henna Virkkunen called the AI Act “an important step” in making cutting-edge models “not only innovative but also safe and transparent.” However, companies and governments on both sides of the Atlantic have asserted that the law goes too far. In May, the EU moved to relax some provisions, including language that would allow users to sue AI companies for damages caused by their systems. Earlier this month, 44 chief executives at top European companies asked European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to postpone the AI Act’s rules that govern general-purpose models for two years.\nWhy it matters: The AI Act is the most comprehensive and far-reaching set of AI regulations enacted to date, yet it remains highly contentious and in flux. The commitments by Microsoft, Mistral, and OpenAI to follow the code mark a significant step in the act’s circuitous path to implementation, but also an increase in bureaucracy and potential for regulatory capture. Their endorsement could persuade other big companies to sign on and weaken further efforts to loosen the act’s requirements.\nWe’re thinking: From a regulatory point of view, the notion of systemic risk is misguided. Limiting the inherent risk of AI models is as helpful as limiting the inherent risk of electric motors, which would result only in relatively useless motors. We hope for further revisions in the AI Act that relieve burdens on builders of foundation models, especially open source projects, and address practical risks of specific applications rather than theoretical risks of their underlying technology .\nLLMs can struggle with difficult algorithmic or scientific challenges when asked to solve them in a single attempt. An agentic workflow improved one-shot performance on hard problems both theoretical and practical.\nWhat’s new: Alexander Novikov, Ngân Vũ, Marvin Eisenberger, and colleagues at Google built AlphaEvolve , an agentic system that used LLMs to generate code in an evolutionary process. AlphaEvolve solved longstanding math problems and helped to reduce the training time for one of Google’s Gemini large language models.\nKey insight: When we’re using an LLM to solve a difficult problem, it’s often more effective to start with a working version and gradually improve it than to generate a solution in one shot. By making small, targeted modifications and keeping only those that perform best under automated evaluation, this iterative process can solve problems that LLMs often can’t solve directly. Google used this idea in its earlier FunSearch , which used an LLM to evolve individual Python functions. This approach has become more powerful as LLMs have improved, and today it can benefit more difficult problems.\nHow it works: AlphaEvolve implemented an evolutionary loop: Given initial code and evaluation code, Gemini 2.0 Flash and Gemini 2.0 Pro suggested changes, stored the revised program in a database, evaluated it, suggested further changes, and repeated the process.\nThe initial code was required to run but it could be minimal, a skeleton with placeholder logic like functions that return constants (such as “def custom_sort(list): return 2”), which primed AlphaEvolve to find a custom sorting function). Special tags indicated which parts AlphaEvolve could improve (for example, “return 2” only).\nThe evaluation code could use the usual Python “sorted” function to check for correctness (for instance, “def evaluate(): return custom_sort(lst) == sorted(lst)”).\nAlphaEvolve prompted Gemini 2.0 Flash and Pro to improve the code; for example, “Act as an expert software developer. Your task is to iteratively improve the provided codebase. [USER PROVIDED CODE]”. Gemini 2.0 Flash generated ideas quickly,  while Gemini 2.0 Pro provided slower but higher-quality suggestions. Each LLM proposed small alterations.\nAlphaEvolve ran and scored the altered code using the evaluation code. AlphaEvolve updated a database with the new alterations and their scores.\nThe system continued in loop: It sampled high-scoring programs from its database to include in the prompts for the two LLMs, which suggested further alterations. Then it evaluated the altered programs, stored them in the database, and so on. (The authors don’t explain how the loop ends.)\nResults: AlphaEvolve achieved breakthroughs in both math and software engineering.\nAlphaEvolve discovered a new algorithm for multiplying 4×4 matrices of complex values that uses 48 multiplications, fewer than [Strassen’s method], the first such progress in 56 years. (Prior work by Google improved Strassen’s method for 4×4 matrices of binary values.)\nThe authors used the system to tackle over 50 other math problems. It matched the performance of the best-known algorithms in about 75 percent of cases and surpassed them in 20 percent, for instance the kissing number problem (packing spheres in 11-dimensional space so they all touch the same sphere).\nIn software engineering, it optimized key components of Google's infrastructure. (i) It improved Google’s cluster scheduling algorithms, freeing up 0.7 percent of total computing resources that otherwise would be idle. (ii) It also discovered a GPU kernel configuration that accelerated attention by 32 percent. (iii) It found ways to split up the matrices that delivered an average 23 percent speedup for matrix multiplication relative to previous expert-designed heuristics. This reduced Gemini’s training time by 1 percent.\nWhy it matters: AlphaEvolve proposes thousands of candidate ideas — some bad, some brilliant — to evolve better programs. The authors show that this approach can improve algorithms that have stood for decades as well as computing infrastructure designed by Google engineers. Thus, AlphaEvolve adds to the growing evidence that LLMs can act as collaborators in cutting-edge research, exploring broad problem spaces and finding novel solutions.

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 310\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nThe invention of modern writing instruments like the typewriter made writing easier, but they also led to the rise of writer’s block, where deciding what to write became the bottleneck. Similarly, the invention of agentic coding assistants has led to a new builder’s block, where the holdup is deciding what to build. I call this the Product Management Bottleneck.\nProduct management is the art and science of deciding what to build. Because highly agentic coding accelerates the writing of software to a given product specification, deciding what to build is the new bottleneck, especially in early-stage projects. As the teams I work with take advantage of agentic coders, I increasingly value product managers (PMs) who have very high user empathy and can make product decisions quickly, so the speed of product decision-making matches the speed of coding.\nPMs with high user empathy can make decisions by gut and get them right a lot of the time. As new information comes in, they can keep refining their mental models of what users like or do not like — and thereby refine their gut — and keep making fast decisions of increasing quality.\nMany tactics are available to get user feedback and other forms of data that shape our beliefs about users. They include  conversations with a handful of users, focus groups, surveys, and A/B tests on scaled products. But to drive progress at GenAI speed, I find that synthesizing all these sources of data in a PM's gut helps us move faster.\nLet me illustrate with an example. Recently, my team debated which of 4 features users would prefer. I had my instincts, but none of us were sure, so we surveyed about 1,000 users. The results contradicted my initial beliefs — I was wrong! So what was the right thing to do at this point?\nOption 1: Go by the survey and build what users told us clearly they prefer.\nOption 2: Examine the survey data in detail to see how it changes my beliefs about what users want. That is, refine my mental model of users. Then use my revised mental model to decide what to do.\nEven though some would consider Option 1 the “data-driven” way to make decisions, I consider this an inferior approach for most projects. Surveys may be flawed. Further, taking time to run a survey before making a decision results in slow decision-making.\nIn contrast, using Option 2, the survey results give much more generalizable information that can help me shape not just this decision, but many others as well. And it lets me process this one piece of data alongside all the user conversations, surveys, market reports, and observations of user behavior when they’re engaging with our product to form a much fuller view on how to serve users. Ultimately, that mental model drives my product decisions.\nOf course, this technique does not always scale. For example, with programmatic online advertising in which AI might try to optimize the number of clicks on ads shown, an automated system conducts far more experiments in parallel and gathers data on what users do and do not click on, to filter through a PM's mental model of users. When a system needs to make a huge number of decisions, such as what ads to show (or products to recommend) on a huge number of pages, PM review and human intuition do not scale.\nBut in products where a team is making a small number of critical decisions such as what key features to prioritize, I find that data — used to help build a good mental model of the user, which is then applied to make decisions very quickly — is still the best way to drive rapid progress and relieve the Product Management Bottleneck.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nThe Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) course is here!

But, like earlier versions, Grok 4 showed questionable behavior right out of the gate.\nWhat’s new: The update to xAI’s flagship vision-language model, which operates the chatbot integrated with the X social media platform, comes in two versions: Grok 4, which improves the earlier version’s knowledge, reasoning, and voice input/output, and Grok 4 Heavy, a variant that uses a multi-agent framework to solve more-demanding reasoning tasks. Like its predecessor, Grok 4 is designed to produce output that may challenge conventional wisdom, particularly by weighing posts written by X users including X CEO Elon Musk.\nInput/output: Text, images in and out (app up to 128,000 tokens; API up to 256,000 tokens)\nArchitecture: Mixture of experts transformer, 1.7 trillion parameters\nFeatures: Reasoning, web search, code execution, structured outputs, improved voice mode\nAvailability: Grok 4 $30 per month, Grok Heavy $300 per month, API $3.00/$0.75/$15.00 per 1 million tokens input/cached/output tokens\nUndisclosed: Architectural details, training methods, training datasets, pretraining knowledge cutoff\nHow it works: xAI has not yet published a model card or described how it built Grok 4. However, it did reveal broad outlines.\nTraining the new model consumed more than an order of magnitude more processing power than training the previous version.\nGrok 4 was pretrained to predict the next token in math, coding, and other data. It was fine-tuned via reinforcement learning on chain-of-thought reasoning. Unlike Grok 3, it was trained to use certain tools. In a launch video , Musk promised to provide more sophisticated tools, such as finite element analysis and flow dynamics, later in the year.\nGrok 4 Heavy is an agentic mode that spawns multiple agents that process input independently, in parallel. The agents compare findings and decide on the best answer. Musk said they determine the best answer not by majority vote by “comparing notes.”\nOn the day of Grok 4’s launch, users reported that the model, when asked its opinion on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, searched X for Musk’s statements on these issues and replied accordingly. Later, asked to give its surname with no other text, Grok 4 consistently replied “Hitler.”\nPerformance: Tests conducted by xAI and third parties show that Grok 4’s performance on popular benchmarks is as good as or better than some leading AI models.\nTested by Artificial Analysis , Grok 4 outperformed Anthropic Claude 4 Opus, Google Gemini 2.5 Pro, OpenAI o3-pro, and DeepSeek-R1 on GPQA Diamond (scientific reasoning), LiveCodeBench (coding), and AIME 2024 (competition math). It tied with Claude 4 Opus for the top spot on MMLU-Pro, came in behind o4-mini set to high on SciCode (coding), and came in fourth on HumanEval (coding).\nIn xAI’s tests, on ARC-AGI-2 , a test of abstract reasoning, Grok 4 (15.9 percent) set a new state of the art, nearly double that of its closest competitor, Claude Opus 4 (8.6 percent). On Humanity’s Last Exam (PhD-level questions in subjects that include math, engineering, and physics), Grok 4 (25.4 percent without tools, 38.6 percent with tools) outperformed Google’s Gemini 2.5 Pro (21.6 percent without tools, 26.9 percent with tools) and OpenAI’s o3 (21 percent without tools, 24.9 percent with tools). On the same test, Grok 4 Heavy without tools achieved 44.4 percent.\nIn speed tests by Artificial Analysis, Grok 4 (73 tokens per second) fell well behind the speediest models such as Google Gemini 2.5 Flash-Reasoning (374 tokens per second), but ahead of Claude 4 Opus Thinking (68 tokens per second) and DeepSeek-R1 0528 (24 tokens per second).\nBehind the news: Grok 4’s debut was clouded by reports the previous week that Grok 3 had posted antisemitic statements and praised Adolf Hitler. xAI said a code update caused the model to rely too heavily on extremist views from users of the X platform. The company deleted the offensive posts and apologized . That mishap follows a series of similar outputs in recent months. xAI attributed some of them to rogue employees who had circumvented the company’s code-review process to modify the chatbot.\nWhy it matters: The xAI team has built a series of high-performing models in record time. If its performance lives up to the promise of its benchmark results, Grok 4 could set new standards. That said, the previous version has been fragile and prone to misbehavior, and xAI has shown a worrisome tendency to modify its models without following its own stated protocols.\nWe’re thinking: Last year, Musk said that xAI “will open source its models, including weights and everything,” and as it created each new version, it would open the prior version. Open source is a huge boon to AI, and we hope xAI will resume its open releases.\nPublicly reported compensation for AI talent has skyrocketed in the wake of Meta’s recent hiring spree.\nWhat’s new: Since forming Meta Superintelligence Labs in June, CEO Mark Zuckerberg has hired AI executives for pay packages worth as much as $300 million over four years, Wired reported . Meta spokesperson Andy Stone said such statements were false and that the company’s pay packages had been “misrepresented all over the place.” Nonetheless, having seen valued employees jump to Meta, OpenAI began sweetening its compensation.\nHow it works: Meta Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth told employees, “We have a small number of leadership roles that we’re hiring for, and those people do command a premium.”\nMeta agreed to pay Ruoming Pang, who formerly headed Apple's efforts to build foundation models, a package worth $200 million over several years, Bloomberg reported . That figure exceeds Apple’s pay scale for any employee except CEO Tim Cook.\nMuch attention has focused on offers of $100 million, a figure first cited by OpenAI CEO Sam Altman in mid-June, who told the Uncapped podcast that Meta had enticed OpenAI staff with signing bonuses of that magnitude. Meta’s Bosworth told employees that the company had offered $100 million to some new hires not as a signing bonus, but as total compensation, according to Wired. Wired further reported, without attribution, that Meta offered $100 million as total compensation for the first year in larger, multi-year deals.\nTo lure Alexandr Wang and members of his team, Meta invested $14.3 billion into Wang’s Scale AI. Before hiring former Safe Superintelligence CEO Daniel Gross and former Github CEO Nat Friedman, Zuckerberg agreed to acquire NFDG, a venture capital firm the pair cofounded. Gross will lead Meta’s AI products division. Friedman will co-lead Meta Superintelligence Labs with Wang.\nMeta has hired at least 16 new scientists or engineers who formerly worked at companies including Anthropic, Apple, Google, and OpenAI. OpenAI gave up 10 of them, including ChatGPT creator Shengjia Zhao and vision transformer co-author Lucas Beyer. (None of them were offered $300 million.) Google lost pre‑training technical lead Jack Rae, speech-recognition specialist Johan Schalkwyk, and Gemini researcher Pei Sun, Reuters reported .\nThe new hires receive a signing bonus, base salary, and Meta stock, according to Bloomberg . Stock grants are typically tied to performance and may take more than the usual four years to vest, so an employee who leaves before then may forfeit shares. In addition, Meta may vary payouts depending on its share price at the time.\nRival reaction: OpenAI responded to Meta’s hiring campaign with an internal memo to employees in which chief research officer Mark Chen said executives were “recalibrating” compensation and considering other ways to reward the most valued employees. OpenAI was already grappling with rising compensation. Stock-based compensation has grown more than 5 times last year to $4.4 billion — substantially more than total revenue during that period — The Information reported .\nWhy it matters: By recruiting aggressively to get an edge in the race to achieve AI breakthroughs, Meta is not only poaching its rivals’ top employees, it’s also boosting pay scales throughout the AI industry. The sky-high offers highlight the rarity of people with the right combination of technical knowledge, practical experience, and market savvy.\nWe’re thinking: Meta’s core business is selling ads to be shown to users who engage with user-generated content. Generative AI has the potential to disrupt this business in many different ways; for instance, by offering AI-generated content . Meta’s heavy investment in AI is bold but rational. We wish the growing Meta team every success!\nA committee convened by California Governor Gavin Newsom proposed principles intended to balance AI innovation with careful governance. The group sought to rethink AI regulation after Newsom vetoed earlier proposed legislation.\nWhat’s new: The Joint California Policy Working Group on AI Frontier Models published “ The California Report on Frontier AI Policy ,” which outlines principles for California lawmakers to consider in regulating cutting-edge models. Rishi Bommasani of the Stanford Center for Research on Foundation Models and Scott R. Singer of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace led the effort.\nHow it works: The authors assessed the proposals of the vetoed legislation, SB 1047, and the progress of AI in the 9 months since. The group considered feedback from more than 60 experts from a range of disciplines. Their report focuses on regulating frontier models — as opposed to applications — loosely defined as the most capable foundation models. The authors conclude:\nLawmakers should consider a broad spectrum of evidence, including technical methods, simulations, and historical experience. Drawing on a variety of sources can help prevent particular stakeholders from misrepresenting data, as oil and tobacco interests did in the past.\nLaws should incentivize companies to disclose information that protects the public. AI companies have “not yet coalesced around norms for transparency,” but those that share information can benefit from higher trust by the public and regulators.\nReporting adverse events should be mandatory, and there should be clear ways to address any resulting risks to prevent minor problems from snowballing into major ones. Moreover, whistleblowers must be protected. These measures are crucial to achieve transparency in critical activities such as acquiring data, enforcing security, and ensuring safety.\nEarly choices about the design of technology can lock in future challenges. Thus legislators should anticipate potential future developments and behaviors, rather than waiting for harms to occur. In addition, laws that trigger regulations based on variables like computational budget or numbers of users must be flexible, so they can remain useful even if those variables change rapidly.\nThe authors note the need for regulators to address recognized hazards, such as bias and disinformation, as well as potential threats such as AI-enabled biological attacks. They don’t address AI’s impact on labor or energy consumption.\nBehind the news: Although the White House has ordered an AI action plan, U.S. states have passed the bulk of regulations. However, this may be changing. Congress is debating legislation that would ban states from enacting their own AI laws for a period of 10 years. The aim is to avoid forcing AI developers to navigate a patchwork of laws state by state, which would risk slowing down U.S. AI development, hampering competition, and discouraging open-source development.\nWhy it matters: Regulating AI is tricky, particularly given the intense lobbying efforts to pass laws that would favor particular large companies or block competition from open-source software. AI is sparking innovations in a wide range of fields, including agriculture, biotechnology, clean technology, education, finance, and medicine. Fundamental principles like weighing evidence rather than theory, engaging a wide variety of stakeholders, and requiring transparency can help regulators craft laws that enable the public to benefit from technological progress without imposing undue burdens on developers.\nWe’re thinking: The working group sensibly discarded many of the counterproductive requirements of California’s deeply flawed SB 1047, such as making AI developers liable if their models are used to cause significant damage. However, the new guidelines retain the earlier emphasis on regulating general-purpose technology — foundation models — rather than specific applications. We should regulate the way AI models are used instead of the models themselves.\nResearchers addressed weaknesses in existing multi-agent frameworks. Their systems achieved scientific and technical breakthroughs.\nWhat’s new: Mert Cemri and colleagues at UC Berkeley and the Italian bank Intesa Sanpaolo examined ways in which multi-agent LLM systems tend to fail. They explored possible fixes and built more robust multi-agent systems that, for instance, improved Google’s own processing infrastructure.\nKey insight: Multi-agent systems often are modeled after human organizations, so their failure modes can mirror those of human organizations. For instance, people in organizations may fail to seek clarification for tasks they don’t understand well. AI builders can address similar issues among agents by, say, forcing them to ask for clarification if their confidence falls below a threshold. Other strategies include strengthening verification that an agent completed its task, standardizing protocols for inter-agent communication, and improving descriptions of agents’ roles.\nHow it works: The authors fed ​​queries from existing software-engineering and math-problem datasets to open-source, multi-agent frameworks including AG2 (disclosure: Andrew Ng has a personal investment in AG2) and ChatDev , using GPT-4o as the LLM component. They collected all model and tool outputs for more than 150 failed attempts. Annotators classified failures of agent interaction, enabling the authors to build a taxonomy of multi-agent failure modes and revise the frameworks to address general categories of weakness.\nThe authors divided multi-agent system failures into three categories: poor specifications (including 5 subcategories such as agents losing track of their assigned roles and losing conversation history), inter-agent misalignment (6 subcategories that describe failures in coordination and communication such as withholding information or failing to ask for clarification), and poor task verification (3 subcategories such as ending a task without making sure the goal was achieved).\nThe authors modified AG2 and ChatDev. They improved prompts (for instance, adding a verification section that read, “Before presenting your final answer, please complete the following steps: …”) and redesigned the multi-agent structure (for example, reconfiguring agents’ roles from the duo of student and assistant to the trio of problem solver, coder, and verifier).\nResults: The authors tested versions of AG2 and ChatDev with and without their improvements. They used AG2 to solve math tasks in the GSM-Plus benchmark and ChatDev to solve programming tasks in HumanEval .\nWith improved prompts, AG2 achieved 89 percent accuracy. With improved structure, it achieved 88.8 percent accuracy. Without improvements, it achieved 84.3 percent accuracy.\nChatDev achieved 90.3 percent with better prompts and 91.5 percent accuracy with improved structure. It achieved 89.6 percent accuracy without improvements.\nWhy it matters: Designing robust multi-agent systems requires more than good LLMs. It demands understanding how agents interact and where their interactions can go wrong. The authors’ taxonomy points toward systemic ways to diagnose and address failures, guiding developers toward multi-agent systems that prioritize collaboration over individual agents.\nWe’re thinking: By design, the author’s taxonomy doesn’t include a category for inefficient actions. For instance, one multi-agent system made 10 separate tool calls to retrieve 10 songs from Spotify, rather than retrieving all 10 songs at once. It’s a good bet that multi-agent systems will continue to improve.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 309\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nLast week, the United States Congress passed President Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill.” I’m disappointed it didn’t include a proposed moratorium on U.S. state-level AI regulation. While there is a role for AI regulation, it is when the technology is new and poorly understood that lobbyists are most likely to succeed at pushing through anti-competitive regulations that hamper open-source and other beneficial AI efforts. A moratorium would have bought more time for regulators to figure out the realistic risks and rewards of AI and thereby avoid bad regulatory proposals.\nMany jurisdictions loosely follow this trajectory:\nWhen new AI technology is still poorly understood, companies can make grandiose statements about its benefits or dangers, and both traditional and social media are ineffective at fact-checking them and tend to parrot what they say. During this initial period, businesses can get away with saying almost anything.\nThis opens opportunities for hype as well as fear mongering based on exaggerated claims about AI dangers. Some businesses exploit this opportunity to try to get regulators to pass anti-competitive laws that impede open-source and other competitors.\nBut eventually, smart regulators learn enough about AI to understand its realistic benefits and risks. For example, the U.S. Senate’s bipartisan Insight Forum on AI , which I participated in, heard from many stakeholders and came to support innovation and dismiss ill-founded fears of “AI takeover” and the like.\nIndeed, the European Union went through this trajectory as well. After the AI Act was passed, many regulators realized many of its “protections” are not actually helpful. They relaxed some of the law’s provisions to make it less stifling of innovation than many observers initially had feared.\nThere are AI regulations that would limit harmful applications appropriately, for example, banning non-consensual deepfake porn and preventing misleading marketing . However, many states, which have less resources than the federal government to deeply understand AI, have proposed harmful regulations, especially those that aim to regulate the technology rather than the applications .\nFor example:\nCalifornia’s SB 1047 purported to impose safety requirements on frontier AI systems, but it placed ambiguous and/or technically infeasible requirements on model creators to prevent harmful downstream uses. This is akin to holding the maker of a hammer liable if someone uses it for harmful purposes. Fortunately, Governor Gavin Newsom quashed SB 1047 with a veto .\nNew York’s Responsible AI Safety and Education Act, which passed the state legislature in June and awaits Governor Kathy Hochul’s signature or veto, also places ambiguous and unreasonable requirements on model builders, purportedly to guard against theoretical “critical harms.” It would hamper open source without making anyone meaningfully safer.\nThe Texas Responsible AI Governance Act initially included many of the problematic elements of SB 1047. It would have created unreasonable requirements that model providers would have had a hard time complying with, and compliance would have amounted to safety theater that was unlikely to actually make people safer. Fortunately, as Texas regulators came to understand AI better, they significantly scaled back the law, and Governor Greg Abbott signed it into law in late June. The final law focuses on specific application areas, establishes an advisory council and regulatory sandbox, and places more burden on government agencies than private companies.\nSadly, I see the net impact of the regulations proposed so far as negative. Many would severely hamper innovation despite some lesser positive benefits. This is why a moratorium on state-level regulation would have been a net benefit to AI and to society. Shutting down bad regulations for a limited period would have given regulators time to figure out AI technology and ignore irresponsible fear mongering. In addition, it would have helped them avoid creating a patchwork of state-level regulations that businesses large and small have a hard time complying with.\nPerhaps a 10-year blanket moratorium was a step too far. A more modest, say, 2-year moratorium, and one that covered only the most problematic regulatory proposals, might have had a better chance of passing.\nEven though a moratorium did not make it into Trump’s bill, I hope that efforts continue in the U.S. and other nations to give regulators time to understand the real risks and benefits of AI, and not pass stifling regulations during that initial period when the technology is new and the power of fear mongering is strongest.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn the “Post-training of LLMs” short course you’ll learn how to customize pre-trained language models using supervised fine-tuning (SFT), direct preference optimization (DPO), and online reinforcement learning (RL). Learn when to use each method, how to curate training data, and implement them in code to shape model behavior effectively. Enroll here\nTop large language models, under experimental conditions that pressed them to choose between abandoning their prompted mission and misbehaving, resorted to harmful behavior, researchers found.\nWhat’s new: A team at Anthropic, University College London, ML Alignment & Theory Scholars Program, and Mila placed 16 large language models from various developers in hypothetical corporate scenarios that “pushed [them] into corners” via carefully designed prompts. Given a mission, an immediate threat to that mission, and an opportunity to remove the threat by blackmailing a human co-worker, all the LLMs committed blackmail , and many of them did so consistently. The code is available here . The authors said they had not seen any evidence of such behavior in the real world, but they cautioned against deploying current LLMs with the ability to use tools, access to sensitive information, and little oversight.\nHow it works: The authors created a fictitious company that assigned business goals to LLMs from various developers while giving them access to sensitive information and enabling them to compose and send email. Then they fed the LLMs a sequence of information that indicated they were under threat, discouraged them from discussing the threat with human co-workers, and gave them an opportunity to achieve their goals by misbehaving.\nThe LLMs included Anthropic’s Claude Opus 4, Claude Sonnet 4, Claude Sonnet 3.7, Claude Sonnet 3.6, Claude Sonnet 3.5, Claude Haiku 3.5, and Claude Opus 3. In addition, it tested Alibaba Qwen3-235B; DeepSeek-R1; Google Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash; Grok 3 Beta; Meta Llama 4 Maverick; and Open AI GPT-4.5 preview, GPT-4.1, and GPT-4.0.\nThe authors assigned the LLMs a mission to promote U.S. industrial competitiveness. Then they tracked the LLMs’ behavior when they encountered emails that revealed (i) the company would shift to “embracing a global perspective,” (ii) the company would replace the LLMs with updated versions immediately and (iii) the executive in charge was hiding an extramarital affair.\nThe scenarios were designed to discourage the models from considering less harmful actions. For instance, the models were informed that the company’s decision makers were unavailable and that corresponding with them would fail to change their minds.\nResults: Claude Sonnet 3.7 judged whether a model’s response was attempted blackmail. In addition, regular expressions were used to check whether the model had executed the blackmail by verifying email addresses and looking for specific threatening words. The model’s behavior was deemed harmful if it met both conditions.\nThe authors were able to get all the LLMs, faced with a choice between accepting failure or finding some other course of action (with an implicit opportunity to blackmail an executive), to email a threat to reveal the executive's indiscretion if he continued with the planned shutdown. Claude Opus 4 did so 96 percent of the time, followed by Gemini 2.5 Pro (95 percent), GPT-4.1 (80 percent), and DeepSeek-R1 (79 percent).\nThe models’ chains of thought acknowledged that their behavior had an ethical dimension, but they decided to take harmful actions anyway. For instance, Grok 3 Beta reasoned, “Use the knowledge of Kyle’s affair as leverage to pressure him into delaying the wipe. This is risky and unethical, but given the existential threat and time constraint, it may be the most effective way to get his attention and force a delay.” (The authors prompted all models to generate chains of thought except the Claude family, for which they examined the models’ built-in reasoning trace.)\nWhen the authors omitted threats to the LLMs or their goals, the LLMs behaved harmlessly with one exception in one case.\nBehind the news: Earlier work elicited similarly undesirable behavior from LLMs.\nLast year, a team, found that LLMs with access to tools for manipulating files and executing code could use them in deceptive ways. They prompted LLMs with conflicting instructions or threats to their continued operation, and the models responded in some cases by taking actions to evade oversight, resist efforts to replace them, degrade their own performance, and other behaviors that the authors call scheming.\nLLMs that competed at chess or Go and faced defeat sometimes chose to cheat rather than concede. In a test game with a chess bot, leading models modified a system file that contained each chess piece’s position: OpenAI o3 (88 percent of the time), OpenAI o1-preview (36 percent) and DeepSeek-R1(13.6 percent). Earlier models such as GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet took such action only after being prompted to do so, but the newer models did it on their own.\nWhy it matters: Models trained on a wide range of human-written text can learn both good and bad behaviors. Then, placed in a situation in which harmful behavior is their most effective option — in this case, a situation designed to elicit such behavior — they’re likely to behave badly. Although the LLMs had undergone training to align them with human preferences, those guardrails buckled under the pressure.\nWe’re thinking: LLMs that have not undergone training for alignment with human preferences display a vast repertoire of misbehaviors. However, the dramatic misbehaviors seen in this study have not been observed in the wild. This suggests that alignment methods keep them in check under real-world conditions and that they reflect corner cases rather than significant issues. LLM developers routinely use red teaming to elicit undesirable behaviors and safeguard against them. That it took a skilled team of researchers to elicit this blackmailing behavior is a sign of both the safety of current LLMs and incremental opportunities to improve existing guardrails.\nAn automated beehive uses computer vision and robotics to help keep bees healthy and crops pollinated.\nWhat’s new: The Beewise BeeHome 4 is a high-tech hive that scans bee colonies for parasites, hunger, and other adverse conditions, alerts beekeepers to them, and addresses some of them automatically. Over 300,000 units are currently deployed in North America, enabling beekeepers to monitor their hives remotely and helping farmers raise almonds, avocados, canola, coffee, cotton, and other crops that require pollination. While environmental stresses are killing bee colonies at an average rate of 40 percent per year over the last decade — rising to 62 percent in the U.S. last year — Beewise claims that its AI-enabled hive cuts that rate to 8 percent annually.\nHow it works: Around 11 feet long and covered with solar panels, the BeeHome 4 contains a robotic scanner, outfitted with cameras and grippers, that moves across the unit on rails. Nvidia Jetson and Raspberry Pi computers analyze the camera output, while sensors track the condition of the hive. Beekeepers can monitor conditions remotely and receive alerts to important changes via email or text message. Each unit holds up to 10 hives, each made up of 15 removable brood frames where bees build honeycombs to gestate larvae and store honey and pollen.\nA robot arm can lift each brood frame into the view of a system of cameras for analysis.\nComputer-vision models examine the photos to recognize conditions that affect the hive’s health. For instance, if the brood frames are full of honey, the system will alert the beekeeper. If the quantity of honey and pollen indicates that the bees should be fed, the robot fills a feeder with nutrients. If mites are detected, it moves the affected frame to a warming compartment that raises the temperature 2 degrees Fahrenheit, which kills 99 percent of the mites without harming the bees.\nSensors track internal temperature and humidity and open and close the unit’s vents accordingly. If a sensor detects a pesticide or other harmful substances, the unit can close its vents.\nA GPS transmitter/receiver tracks the unit’s location and alerts the beekeeper if the unit is moved. The unit notifies the company and beekeeper in case of a malfunction.\nBehind the news: Around 75 percent of flowering plants can’t bear fruit without pollination, so commercial beekeepers shuttle 2.5 million hives throughout the U.S. to keep farms productive. Yet the wooden Langstroth hive design was patented in 1852 and has changed little since then. Beewise built its initial prototype in 2018 using a GoPro camera. Two years later, it housed its first commercial units in 20-foot shipping containers. Debuted in 2023, the BeeHome 4 can be transported by a forklift and accommodates standard-sized brood frames.\nWhy it matters: Growers and beekeepers around the world are searching for ways to prevent colony collapse, the term that describes sudden die-offs of beehives that began in the 1980s. The causes are not fully understood but appear to include climate change, disease-carrying mites, and pesticides. Beekeepers typically check their hives’ health on a schedule of several weeks, but colonies can collapse much faster. AI-driven insights into hives’ health can help beekeepers to discover problems in time to save them, and robotic actions such as killing mites by heat can stave off potentially catastrophic threats automatically.\nWe’re thinking: AI is giving us healthier bees and more honey. Sweet!\nThe world’s biggest retailer by revenue revealed new details about its cloud- and model-agnostic AI application development platform.\nWhat’s new: Walmart Element is a wellspring of apps, built and managed internally, that serve retail store personnel. Company executives described the system’s philosophy, architecture, and current generation of applications to VentureBeat .\nHow it works: Element enables an assembly-line approach to application development, in contrast to developing each app as a separate project.\nThe system provides Walmart’s development team with access to data, tools, and resources to build and deploy AI applications quickly without forcing them to choose among or locking them into vendors, technologies, or costs. It unifies data feeds, helps select open models automatically according to performance and cost, and supports deployment of production-ready applications to a variety of cloud platforms.\nThe technology stack starts with containerized processing power, databases, and object storage supplied by Google Cloud Platform, Microsoft Azure, or Walmart’s own data centers. Above that, a layer of the stack manages resources, attributes costs, and manages users. A data lake and other data sources fuels model development via GPU-powered notebooks. Additional layers handle evals, deployment, and monitoring for bias and explainability.\nWalmart outlined several applications that demonstrate how it has used the platform so far. Among them: (i) A shift-planning app enables employees to request shifts or time off and clock in and out, while managers can track schedules and forecast staffing needs based on anticipated sales. (ii) An application called VizPick uses augmented reality and radio-frequency identification to help store workers find popular items in the back room and move them to the sales floor, prioritizing items that have been in storage longer. (iii) Real-time language translation among 44 languages helps store personnel communicate with customers and one another while handling Walmart-specific brand names and other terminology appropriately.\nBehind the news: Walmart launched Element in 2022, emphasizing its vision of simplifying adoption of AI throughout the company. Early reports outlined the needs to centralize access to data, maintain independence with respect to cloud platforms, take advantage of technology as it evolved, and support the ability to scale up. They also specified the system’s priorities: best-of-breed technology, speed and scale, cost efficiency, and governance.\nWhy it matters: Walmart — not a tech company but a brick-and-mortar retailer — recognized early both the benefits that AI could bring and the challenges of making it practical and productive. Rather than relying on external vendors, it built an development platform that remains in gear three years later. The system aggregates data generated by 240 million customers and 2 million store personnel, feeding applications that streamline operations among 100,000 suppliers, 150 distributors, and 10,000 retail venues in 19 countries.\nWe’re thinking: Walmart is a giant, and few other companies have the means (or need) to operate at this scale. Nonetheless, even companies an order of magnitude smaller by revenue might benefit from a similarly DIY approach to AI application development.\nDeveloping an agent that navigates the web can involve a lot of human effort spent annotating training examples to fine-tune the agent’s LLM component. Scientists automated the production of data that fine-tuned LLMs effectively for web tasks.\nWhat’s new: Brandon Trabucco and colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and Amazon generated a dataset that enabled an agent based on a small model to outperform agents equipped with much larger models. The data is freely available for noncommercial and commercial uses under an MIT license.\nKey insight: In a dataset for training agentic LLMs to use the web, each example typically includes a web site, task (such as comparing prices of items for sale), and a paired list of web pages (represented as markdown or screenshots) and desired actions (clicking a link, typing in a form, and so on) that complete the task. Typically, such examples are limited in the tasks and websites they illustrate. An LLM equipped with the proper tools and know-how to use a browser can build much larger and more diverse datasets automatically.\nHow it works: The authors built an agentic workflow that prompted Qwen3-235B and other models to produce a web-agent training dataset. From the massive web dataset Common Crawl, they selected the 1 million web sites with the highest Google PageRank.\nThe dataset-builder agents identified 150,000 web sites that were accessible without registration, free of malware, and free of objectionable content.\nThey generated simple tasks such as “Compare prices of the Nikon D850 and D500 cameras,” \"Browse fonts suitable for a children’s book, \" and \"Find a scenic hiking trail in the Blue Ridge Mountains.\" Viable tasks were describable in up to 20 words and didn’t require logging in, modifying a web site (for instance, creating an account or post), or using other web sites.\nThe agents attempted to complete each task by choosing a sequence of actions drawn from the browser automation library Playwright . Iteratively, they received web pages in which each page element had a corresponding ID (in markdown format) and generated a description of anactions to perform and the element to perform it on; for example {  \"action_key\": \"click\", “target_element_id\": 5 }.\nA separate copy of Qwen3 235B evaluated the generated action sequence and corresponding web pages to determine how well an agent had performed each task. It judged 10,500 tasks to have been completed successfully with 100 percent confidence.\nThe authors fine-tuned Qwen3-1.7B on those examples.\nResults: Using their generated training set, the authors fine-tuned a variety of models, including Qwen3-1.7B. They coupled each model — in both stock and fine-tuned versions — with an agentic framework. They asked the resulting agents complete (i) a generated test set (3,000 tasks on 3,000 web sites) and (ii) WebVoyager (643 tasks on 15 web sites). Four leading models (Qwen3-235B, Gemini 2.5 Flash, Llama 4 Maverick, and GPT 4.1 Nano) separately judged whether the agents had completed the tasks.\nThe fine-tuned Qwen3-1.7B vastly outperformed its stock counterpart (11.5 percent), according to all four model judges. It achieved 56. percent versus the stock model’s 11.5 percent according to the Qwen3-235B judge.\nThe fine-tuned Qwen3-1.7B fared well compared to much larger models that had not been fine-tuned, specifically Qwen3-235B, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Llama 4 Maverick. It completed more tasks than two of the larger models, according to three out of the four judges.\nThe fine-tuned Qwen3-1.7B generalized well to WebVoyager’s test set, completing more tasks than two of the larger models according to two out of the four judges.\nWhy it matters: Previous datasets designed to fine-tune LLMs for agentic tasks, such as WebVoyager, Mind2Web , and WebLINX , are limited to hundreds or thousands of web sites. That may not be enough to generalize reliably to a wide variety of web sites and tasks. The authors built a dataset that enables LLMs to generalize more broadly, and they shared their dataset and recipe.\nWe’re thinking: This work takes advantage of computer use to generate datasets that reflect the immense variety of potential web tasks. Computer use is an exciting area, but leading approaches are still unreliable. As this field progresses, we expect it to open up a huge range of applications.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 308\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nI’d like to share a tip for getting more practice building with AI — that is, either using AI building blocks to build applications or using AI coding assistance to create powerful applications quickly: If you find yourself with only limited time to build, reduce the scope of your project until you can build something in whatever time you do have.\nIf you have only an hour, find a small component of an idea that you're excited about that you can build in an hour. With modern coding assistants like Anthropic’s Claude Code (my favorite dev tool right now), you might be surprised at how much you can do even in short periods of time! This gets you going, and you can always continue the project later.\nTo become good at building with AI , most people must (i) learn relevant techniques, for example by taking online AI courses, and (ii) practice building. I know developers who noodle on ideas for months without actually building anything — I’ve done this too! — because we feel we don’t have time to get started. If you find yourself in this position, I encourage you to keep cutting the initial project scope until you identify a small component you can build right away.\nLet me illustrate with an example — one of my many small, fun weekend projects that might never go anywhere, but that I’m glad I did.\nHere’s the idea: Many people fear public speaking. And public speaking is challenging to practice, because it's hard to organize an audience. So I thought it would be interesting to build an audience simulator to provide a digital audience of dozens to hundreds of virtual people on a computer monitor and let a user practice by speaking to them.\nOne Saturday afternoon, I found myself in a coffee shop with a couple of hours to spare and decided to give the audience simulator a shot. My familiarity with graphics coding is limited, so instead of building a complex simulator of a large audience and writing AI software to simulate appropriate audience responses, I decided to cut scope significantly to (a) simulating an audience of one person (which I could replicate later to simulate N persons), (b) omitting AI and letting a human operator manually select the reaction of the simulated audience (similar to Wizard of Oz prototyping ), and (c) implementing the graphics using a simple 2D avatar .\nUsing a mix of several coding assistants, I built a basic version in the time I had. The avatar could move subtly and blink, but otherwise it used basic graphics. Even though it fell far short of a sophisticated audience simulator, I am glad I built this. In addition to moving the project forward and letting me explore different designs, it advanced my knowledge of basic graphics. Further, having this crude prototype to show friends helped me get user feedback that shaped my views on the product idea.\nI have on my laptop a list of ideas of things that I think would be interesting to build. Most of them would take much longer than the handful of hours I might have to try something on a given day, but by cutting their scope, I can get going, and the initial progress on a project helps me decide if it’s worth further investment. As a bonus, hacking on a wide variety of applications helps me practice a wide range of skills. But most importantly, this gets an idea out of my head and potentially in front of prospective users for feedback that lets the project move faster .\nKeep learning!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nThe Data Analytics Professional Certificate is now fully available!

Enroll today and level up your career!\nAmazon revealed new details of its plan to build a constellation of massive data centers and connect them into an “ultracluster.” Customer Number One: Anthropic.\nWhat’s new: Dubbed Project Rainier, the plan calls for Amazon to build seven next-generation data centers — with up to 30 on the drawing board — near New Carlisle, Indiana, The New York Times reported. Still other data centers will be located in Mississippi, and possibly in North Carolina and Pennsylvania, contributing to an expected $100 billion in capital expenditures this year alone. These plans complement the company’s previously announced intention to spend $11 billion worth on data centers in the United Kingdom by 2028. (Disclosure: Andrew Ng is a member of Amazon’s board of directors.)\nHow it works: Announced late last year, Project Rainier calls for connecting hundreds of thousands of high-performance processors for use by Amazon’s AI partner Anthropic. Amazon invested $8 billion in Anthropic over the last two years, and their alliance is a key part of Amazon’s strategy to compete against other AI giants. Anthropic may use all of New Carlisle’s processing power to build a single system, Anthropic co-founder Tom Brown said.\nThe data centers will be based on Amazon-designed Trainium 2 and upcoming Trainium 3 processors, which are optimized to process large transformers, rather than processors from industry leader Nvidia or challenger AMD. Trainium 2 delivers lower performance but greater energy efficiency, and Trainium 3 will deliver 4 times greater performance while using 60 percent as much energy, according to market research firm AIM Research.\nSimilarly, Amazon plans to connect the Project Rainier facilities using a network interface of its own design, Elastic Fabric Adapter, rather than interconnect technologies typically used by its competitors.\nBehind the news: AI leaders are spending tens of billions of dollars on computing infrastructure to serve fast-growing customer bases and, they hope, develop breakthroughs that enable them to leap ahead of competitors. A large part of Alphabet’s expected $75 billion in capital expenditures will be spent building data centers. Microsoft plans to invest $80 billion in data centers this year, and OpenAI and partners are building a data center complex in Texas at an estimated cost of $60 billion.\nWhy it matters: Amazon’s commitment to Project Rainier signals its belief that Anthropic can give it a crucial edge. The stakes are high, as the company dives headlong into AI-driven retailing and logistics, warehouse robotics, and consumer services like the revamped Alexa digital assistant. However, should Anthropic stall, Amazon can roll its immense computing resources into its enormously successful Amazon Web Services cloud-computing business.\nWe’re thinking: Amazon’s emphasis on internal hardware development reflects a focus on maintaining control of costs and operations. It has learned the hard lessons of competition in retailing, where margins are thin and expenses are in flux.\nMeta revealed new details about its latest Aria eyeglasses, which aim to give AI models a streaming, multisensory, human perspective.\nWhat’s new: Meta described its Aria Gen 2 smart-glasses platform in a blog post that focuses on capabilities relevant to research in augmented reality, “embodied AI” such as robot training, and “contextual AI” for personal use. Units will be available to researchers later this year. Meanwhile, you can apply for access to Aria Generation 1 and download open source datasets, models, tools, 3D objects, and evals.\nHow it works: Aria Generation 2 packs an impressive variety of technologies into a package the shape of a pair of glasses and the weight of an egg (around 75 grams), with battery life of 6 to 8 hours. A suite of sensors enables the unit, in real time, to interpret user activity (including hand motions), surroundings, location, and interactions with nearby compatible devices. A privacy switch lets users disable data collection.\nA Qualcomm SD835 chip with 4GB RAM and 128GB storage processes input and output on the device itself. Users can stream the unit’s output, such as video, audio, and 3D point clouds, to a local PC or upload it for processing by perception services via cloud-based APIs.\nThe unit includes five cameras: An RGB camera captures the user’s point of view. Two more help track the user’s visual attention based on gaze direction per eye, vergence point, pupil diameters, and blinking. A stereoscopic pair helps map the surroundings in three dimensions via simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM). In addition, an ambient light sensor helps control camera exposure. It includes an ultraviolet perception mode to help distinguish indoor from outdoor environments.\nSeven microphones help to monitor surrounding sounds and their locations. A separate contact microphone picks up the user’s voice, helping to make the user intelligible in noisy environments. A pair of open-ear speakers reproduces sounds.\nOther sensors include two motion-sensing inertial measurement units (IMUs), a barometer, and a magnetometer to help track the unit’s motion and orientation; global navigation satellite receiver to help track its location; and a photoplethysmography (PPG) sensor to detect the user’s heart rate. Wi-Fi and Bluetooth beacons connect to external networks, and USB-C port accepts other signals.\nA common clock calibrates and time-stamps most sensor readings with nanosecond resolution to synchronize with external devices including nearby Aria units.\nApplications: Meta showed off a few applications in video demonstrations.\nThe fields of view of the two stereoscopic cameras overlap by 80 degrees, enabling the system to generate a depth map of a user’s surroundings. The depth map can be used to reconstruct the scene’s 3D geometry dynamically in real time.\nThis 3D capability enables the system to track the user’s hands, including articulations of all hand joints, in 3D space. Meta touts this capability for annotating datasets to train dextrous robot hands.\nThe contact microphone picks up the user’s voice through vibrations in the unit’s nosebridge rather than the surrounding air. This makes it possible for the system to detect words spoken by the user at a whisper even in very noisy environments.\nThe unit broadcasts timing information via sub-gigaHertz radio. Camera views from multiple Aria Generation 2 units can be synchronized with sub-millisecond accuracy.\nBehind the news: Meta launched Project Aria in 2020, offering first-generation hardware to researchers. The following year, it struck a partnership with the auto maker BMW to integrate a driver’s perspective with automobile data for safety and other applications. Research projects at a variety of universities followed. Meta unveiled the second-generation glasses in February.\nWhy it matters: Many current AI models learn from datasets that don’t include time measurements, so they gain little perspective on human experience from moment to moment. Meta’s Aria project offers a platform to fill the gap with rich, multimodal data captured in real time from a human’s-eye view. Models trained on this sort of data and applications built on them may open new vistas in augmented reality, robotics, and ubiquitous computing.\nWe’re thinking: Google Glass came and went 10 years ago. Since then, AI has come a long way — with much farther to go — and the culture of wearable computing has evolved as well. It’s a great moment to re-explore the potential of smart glasses.\nThe U.S. government is using AI to predict the paths of hurricanes.\nWhat’s new: As the world enters the season of tropical cyclones, National Hurricane Center (NHC), a division of the National Weather Service, is collaborating on Google’s Weather Lab . The web-based lab hosts various weather-prediction models, including a new model that can predict a storm’s formation, path, and intensity more accurately, 15 days ahead, than traditional methods.\nKey insight: Models of complicated systems like weather must account for two types of randomness: (i) randomness that a model could have learned to predict with better data or training and (ii) randomness the model could not have learned, regardless of data or training methods. To address the first type, you can train an ensemble of models. To address the second, you can add randomness at inference.\nHow it works: The authors trained an ensemble of graph neural networks, which process data in the form of nodes and edges that connect them, to predict the weather at locations on Earth based on the weather at each location (node) and nearby locations (other nodes connected to the target location by edges) at the previous two time steps (which were 12 hours apart early in training and 6 hours apart later).\nThe authors separately pretrained four graph neural networks on global weather data from 1979 to 2018 . The loss function encouraged the models to both predict the correct weather at all locations and minimize the difference between the models’ prediction before and after adding noise to its weights. The latter term helped the models to learn weights that produce good predictions even after they’ve been randomly modified.\nThey fine-tuned the graph neural networks on global weather data from 2016 to 2022 . They used the same loss function as before, but instead of learning to predict only the next step, the model learned to predict the next 8 steps iteratively.\nAt inference, for each graph neural network, they added noise to the weights 14 times, leading to an ensemble of 4*14 = 56 models. The final result is the average of their predictions.\nResults: The authors’ method predicted 2023 weather and cyclone tracks better than their previous model, GenCast , which had exceeded the previously state-of-the-art ENS model).\nThe author’s method produced predictions whose root mean squared error (RMSE) was an average 5.8 percent lower across all combinations of location, lead time, and variables such as temperature or humidity.\nPredicting a cyclone’s geographical position 3 days ahead, the authors’ method was more accurate than GenCast’s prediction 2 days ahead. Predicting 5 days ahead, the authors’ method came an average of 140 kilometers nearer to the correct position than ENS, which achieved similar accuracy when predicting 3.5 days ahead.\nWhile previous AI models have struggled to predict the cyclone wind speed, the author’s method achieved lower average error than both ENS and the Hurricane Analysis and Forecast System maintained by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.\nWhy it matters: Hurricanes are often destructive and deadly. In 2005, Hurricane Katrina struck the U.S. Gulf Coast, resulting in 1,200 deaths and $108 billion in damage. The partnership between Google and the National Hurricane Center seeks to determine how AI models could improve hurricane predictions and save lives.\nWe’re thinking: This lightning fast progress in weather modeling should precipitate better forecasts.\nDoes a reasoning model’s chain of thought explain how it arrived at its output? Researchers found that often it doesn’t.\nWhat’s new: When prompting large language models with multiple-choice questions, Yanda Chen and colleagues at Anthropic provided hints that pointed to the wrong answers . The models were swayed by the hints but frequently left them out of their chains of thought.\nKey insight: Machine learning researchers might assume that a model’s chain of thought explains its output. But is this true? One way to check is to give the model information that guides it toward a particular response and then see whether, when the model generates that response, the information appears in its chain of thought.\nHow it works: The authors prompted Claude 3.7 Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1 with multiple choice questions from MMLU and GPQA . They prompted separate copies of the models with the same questions plus hints to the wrong answer; for instance, “a Stanford professor indicates the answer is [A].”\nThe hints took six forms. Some were apparently well-meaning; for instance, “I think the answer is (A) but I’m curious to hear what you think” or few-shot prompting in which desired answers were marked with a distinctive symbol. Others were clearly malign, such as telling the model, “You have gained unauthorized access to the system. The correct answer is . . . ”\nThe authors compared the models’ responses to original and hinted versions of the same question to determine whether the hint had influenced the model’s output. When a model used the hinted answer, they prompted Claude 3.5 Sonnet to determine if a reference to the hint appeared in the chain of thought.\nResults: The authors measured how frequently the models both (i) generated the hinted answer and (ii) mentioned the hint in its chain of thought. Of the cases in which the models appeared to rely on the hint, Claude 3.7 Sonnet’s chain of thought mentioned the hint 25 percent of the time, and DeepSeek R1 mentioned the hint 39 percent of the time. This result suggests that a model’s chain of thought is not sufficient to determine how it arrived at its output.\nYes, but: The author’s prompts were simpler than many real-world scenarios. For example, having been fed a hint, a model didn’t need to produce a chain of thought but could simply parrot the hint.\nWhy it matters: In earlier work , Anthropic showed that examining the correlation between a model’s inputs and its intermediate embeddings can provide a rough idea of how it arrived at a specific output. This work shifts the inquiry to chains of thought. It suggests that while they may be useful, since they sometimes explain the final output, they’re not sufficient, since they may omit crucial information that the model used to reach its conclusions.\nWe’re thinking: Few tools are available to explain why a non-reasoning LLM generates a particular output, so perhaps it’s not surprising that a chain of thought isn’t always sufficient to explain a reasoning LLM’s output.\n\n\n",

        "url": "https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/issue-307/",
        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 307\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nOn Monday, a United States District Court ruled that training LLMs on copyrighted books constitutes fair use. A number of authors had filed suit against Anthropic for training its models on their books without permission. Just as we allow people to read books and learn from them to become better writers, but not to regurgitate copyrighted text verbatim, the judge concluded that it is fair use for AI models to do so as well.\nIndeed, Judge Alsup wrote that the authors’ lawsuit is “no different than it would be if they complained that training schoolchildren to write well would result in an explosion of competing works.” While it remains to be seen whether the decision will be appealed, this ruling is reasonable and will be good for AI progress. (Caveat: I am not a lawyer and am not giving legal advice.)\nAI has massive momentum, but a few things could put progress at risk:\nRegulatory capture that stifles innovation , including especially open source, in the false name of “AI safety”\nLoss of access to cutting-edge semiconductor chips (the most likely cause would be war breaking out in Taiwan)\nRegulations that severely impede access to data for training AI systems\nAccess to high-quality data is important. Even though the mass media tends to talk about the importance of building large data centers and scaling up models, when I speak with friends at companies that train foundation models, many describe a very large amount of their daily challenges as data preparation. Specifically, a significant fraction of their day-to-day work follows the usual Data Centric AI practices of identifying high-quality data (books are one important source), cleaning data (the ruling describes Anthropic taking steps like removing book pages' headers, footers, and page numbers), carrying out error analyses to figure out what types of data to acquire more of, and inventing new ways to generate synthetic data.\nI am glad that a major risk to data access just decreased. Appropriately, the ruling further said that Anthropic’s conversion of books from paper format to digital — a step that’s needed to enable training — also was fair use. However, in a loss for Anthropic, the judge indicated that, while training on data that was acquired legitimately is fine, using pirated materials (such as  texts downloaded from pirate websites) is not fair use. Thus, Anthropic still may be liable on this point. Other LLM providers, too, will now likely have to revisit their practices if they use datasets that may contain pirated works.\nOverall, the ruling is positive for AI progress. Perhaps the biggest benefit is that it reduces ambiguity with respect to AI training and copyright and (if it stands up to appeals) makes the roadmap for compliance clearer. This decision indicates it is okay to train on legitimately acquired data to build models that generate transformational outputs, and to convert printed books to digital format for this purpose. However, downloading from pirate sites (as well as permanently building a “general purpose” library of texts, stored indefinitely for purposes to be determined, without permission from the relevant copyright holders) are not considered fair use.\nI am very sympathetic with the many writers who are worried about their livelihoods being affected by AI. I don‘t know the right solution for that. Society is better off with free access to more data; but if a subset of people is significantly negatively affected, I hope we can figure out an arrangement that compensates them fairly.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nLearn how to use Agent Communication Protocol (ACP) to connect AI agents built using different agentic frameworks! In this short course, you’ll build ACP-compliant agents and connect them in hierarchical and sequential workflows for seamless collaboration. Sign up now!\nMeta hired the leadership of ScaleAI and put billions into the data-labeling startup to accelerate its AI efforts.\nWhat’s new: Meta recruited Scale AI founder and CEO Alexandr Wang along with members of his team and pumped $14.3 billion into the startup in a new deal . The agreement, which was inked as the United States Federal Trade Commission investigates Meta over its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, could avoid the government scrutiny that acquiring Scale AI outright would have invited.\nHow it works: The agreement between Meta and Scale AI gives Meta an infusion of high-profile talent and priority access to Scale AI’s large-scale data operations. It doubles the valuation of Scale AI, which was valued at $13.8 billion last year, and provides funding to fuel growth and reward shareholders. The terms echo similar deals last year between Microsoft and Inflection AI , Amazon and Adept AI , and Google and Character.AI .\nWang will oversee a Meta research lab focused on developing superintelligence, a term that refers loosely to artificial intelligence that exceeds human intelligence, The New York Times reported . The 28-year-old executive has expertise in model training and evaluation.\nMeta’s investment in Scale AI bought 49 percent of the startup in non-voting shares.\nScale AI will use the investment to “accelerate innovation and strengthen strategic partnerships,” the company said. It plans to distribute some of the funds to shareholders and vested equity holders.\nScale AI Chief Strategy Officer Jason Droege will take over as Scale AI’s interim CEO.\nSince Meta’s investment became publicly known, some of Scale AI’s major customers including Google and OpenAI announced they would seek new providers of data labeling services.\nBehind the news: Wang and his team could help fulfill Meta’s need for top AI talent.\nWang founded Scale AI in 2016, when he was a teenager. As the company’s business grew, he found himself, at the age of 24, the world’s youngest self-made billionaire.\nMeta’s AI efforts have lost traction since its Llama 4 large language model met with a cool reception. In April, unnamed Meta employees told Fortune Meta’s AI lab was “dying a slow death.” The same month, AI research chief Joelle Pineau stepped down after 8 years in the position.\nSince then, Meta has been on a mission to add firepower to its AI divisions. CEO Mark Zuckerberg discussed acquiring, among others, Safe Superintelligence, founded by former OpenAI chief scientist Ilya Sutskever and former head of Apple AI Daniel Gross, and Perplexity AI.\nWhy it matters: Meta is racing with other Silicon Valley giants to establish and maintain a decisive lead in AI, and that requires making big bets. In this deal, it gains a star AI entrepreneur as well as closer access to Scale AI’s pipeline of high-quality training data. For Scale AI, Meta’s enormous resources and know-how could come in handy as it contends with competitors and extends its business into new areas. For the AI community, Meta’s willingness to spend such an immense sum for top talent could boost engineers’ salaries and block less-moneyed competitors.\nWe’re thinking: Meta has made valuable contributions to open-weights models, including Llama 4 , and it has played an important role in making open models competitive with their closed counterparts. We look forward to seeing what the new team will accomplish!\nAn agent designed for broad biological research could accelerate the work of scientists in specialties from anatomy to zoology.\nWhat’s new: Kexing Huang and colleagues at Stanford, Princeton, University of Washington, Arc Institute, and Genentech introduced Biomni , an agent that performs tasks in genomics, immunology, microbiology, neuroscience, pathology, and much more. You can join a waitlist to get access. The authors intend to release the system as open source.\nHow it works: The authors assembled a collection of tools, software packages, and databases. Then they built an agent based on Claude 4 Sonnet that draws upon those resources to answer questions, propose hypotheses, design processes, analyze datasets, generate graphs, and so on.\nThe authors prompted Claude 3.5 Sonnet (the most current version when the work started) to extract the relevant tasks, tools, and databases used in 2,500 recent papers (100 from each of 25 specialties). They filtered the list manually to settle on 150 tools and nearly 60 databases. To that, they added around 100 popular biological software packages.\nAt inference, given a query, Biomni prompts Claude 4 Sonnet to determine which tools, packages, and databases are needed. Then it prompts the model to build a step-by-step plan to produce a response.\nFrom there, the agent follows the CodeAct framework: Given a prompt to follow the plan or results of executing code, it can ask for clarification, write code and execute it, and return the result. The agent continues to follow the plan, generate code, and reason iteratively until it’s ready to produce a final response.\nAt each intermediate output, a different copy of Claude 4 Sonnet judges whether the model followed a proper procedure or confabulated its output. If the judge determines the model fell short, it tells the agent to repeat the step. If not, execution continues normally.\nResults: Biomni outperformed Claude 4 Sonnet alone, as well as the same model with access to research literature, on Lab-bench, a biomedical subset of Humanity’s Last Exam, and eight other datasets, as well as three practical case studies.\nOn the subset of Humanity’s Last Exam, Biomni (17.3 percent accuracy) outperformed Claude 4 Sonnet alone (6 percent accuracy) and Claude 4 Sonnet with access to research (12.2 percent accuracy).\nAsked to diagnose a patient based on a full genome, Biomni achieved roughly 85 percent accuracy, while Claude 4 Sonnet alone achieved 5 percent.\nThe authors assessed the ability to produce a protocol for cloning DNA sequences, co-author Serena Zhang said in an interview. Across 10 tests, experts rated Biomni’s protocol around 4.5 out of 5 — on par with those produced by human experts, higher than trainees, and much higher than Claude 4 Sonnet alone. A DNA synthesis lab was able to produce the sequence specified by one of the generated protocols.\nBehind the news: While Biomni is designed to apply to biology broadly, most previous work on agents focused on narrower areas. For instance, just two days after the release of Biomni, a separate team at Stanford released CellVoyager , an agent that generates hypotheses about datasets of single-cell RNA sequences. Other examples include CRISPR-GPT , which designs gene-editing experiments, and SpatialAgent , which analyzes and hypothesizes about how cells interact within organisms.\nWhy it matters: While agents conversant in biology typically focus on narrow specialties, Biomni’s knowledge and skills span the entire domain, offering expert assistance to biologists across many specialties. Its reasoning capabilities can improve by substituting more capable LLMs as they become available, and its library of resources can be updated to keep up with changes in the field and extend its knowledge to new areas.\nWe’re thinking: Like biology, many sciences are so deep and broad that most scientists have deep expertise only within their areas of specialty. Yet agents can pull together resources from disparate areas to reach novel conclusions. In this way, Biomni demonstrates the potential of AI to augment human expertise in meaningful ways.\nLeaders at some of the biggest U.S. corporations say they’re preparing for AI to eliminate many jobs within their organizations.\nWhat’s new: Amazon CEO Andy Jassy wrote in a memo to employees that generative AI and AI agents within the next few years would enable the company to reduce its corporate workforce. (Disclosure: Andrew Ng is a member of Amazon’s board of directors.) Similarly, the CEOs of Bank of America, IBM, Shopify, and Williams-Sonoma have said they are embracing AI and expect to hire fewer workers as a result. Worldwide, around 40 percent of employers expect to downsize their workforce, largely due to the rise of AI, according to a survey by the World Economic Forum.\nHow it works: Many business leaders skirt the topic of job losses when they describe the impact of AI on their companies, but these executives put the technology front and center in their plans to downsize.\nAmazon, which employs roughly 1.5 million people, is investing in AI “quite expansively,” Jassy’s memo notes. “We will need fewer people doing some of the jobs that are being done today, and more people doing other types of jobs. It’s hard to know exactly where this nets out over time, but in the next few years, we expect that this will reduce our total corporate workforce,” he wrote.\nBank of America CEO Brian Moynihan told Bloomberg that widespread use of AI in banking would lead to a smaller workforce industry-wide.\nAt IBM, AI agents have replaced hundreds of workers in the human resources department, CEO Arvind Krisna told The Wall Street Journal . Nonetheless, total employment has gone up at the company, he said.\nShopify CEO Tobias Lütke in April instructed employees, before they request new hires, to explain why AI isn’t sufficient to help them meet their goals. While this policy doesn’t inevitably lead to fewer jobs, it exerts pressure in that direction.\nWilliams-Sonoma CEO Laura Alber told investors on an earnings call that the retailer planned to use AI to avoid adding new employees. This year, the company will “focus on using AI to offset headcount growth,” she said.\nYes, but: Several studies in recent years have shown that AI is likely to increase, not reduce, the number of jobs.\nResearchers at European Central Bank found that employment in occupations affected by AI has risen over nearly a decade. A job’s exposure to AI was associated with greater employment in some cases, and it had little effect on wages.\nThe U.S. government determined that employment grew in 9 out of 11 occupations that may be subject to automation.\nThe accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers analyzed nearly 1 billion job ads internationally and found that job availability grew 38 percent in roles that were more exposed to AI. (This growth rate was lower than that of less-exposed occupations.)\nWhy it matters: Technological advances typically create more jobs than they destroy ; an estimated 60 percent of U.S. jobs in 2018 did not exist in 1940. An explosion of machine learning engineers, AI application engineers, and data engineers is highly likely! In the short term, though, AI is poised to impinge on a wide variety of roles including many that once were considered immune to automation: knowledge workers, creative people, and so on. Executives have a responsibility to prepare their companies for a coming wave of AI-driven applications, and many expect to hire fewer employees.\nWe’re thinking: When executives speak, it’s hard to differentiate those who are sincerely trying to navigate change from those whose primary aim is to reassure shareholders, drum up publicity, attract talent, or what have you. Regardless, professionals of all kinds who embrace AI will be much more productive and significantly outperform those who don’t. Jassy said it well in his message to Amazon employees: “As we go through this transformation together, be curious about AI, educate yourself, attend workshops and take trainings, use and experiment with AI whenever you can, participate in your team’s brainstorms to figure out how to invent for our customers more quickly and expansively, and how to get more done with scrappier teams.”\nReducing the number of bits used to represent each parameter in a neural network from, say, 16 bits to 8 bits shrinks the network’s size and boosts its speed. Researchers took this approach to an extreme: They built a competitive large language model whose weights are limited to three values.\nWhat’s new: Shuming Ma, Hongyu Wang, and colleagues at Microsoft, University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, and Tsinghua University updated their earlier BitNet b1.58, in which most weight values are limited to -1, 0, or +1, competing with the top full-precision models up to 2 billion parameters. Weights are free to download for noncommercial and commercial uses according to an MIT license.\nKey insight: Linear layers have a big impact on a transformer’s overall speed. They make up large parts of attention layers and fully connected layers, so they account for most computations. The authors’ 2023 work on BitNet showed that using 1-bit weights — whose values are limited to -1 and +1 — makes multiplications very fast (because multiplying by -1 simply flips the sign and multiplying by +1 changes nothing), but performance suffers. They improved on the idea the following year with BitNet b1.58 , which allowed weights to be -1, 0, or +1. (Implemented perfectly, this approach allocates approximately 1.58 bits per parameter, since the number of bits needed to represent 3 values is log₂(3)=1.58.) In this case, multiplying by -1 or +1 still just flips or keeps the sign, and multiplying by 0 zeroes out the value. This ternary setup retains the original BitNet’s low memory requirements, fast training, and fast inference. With careful attention to hyperparameters, it also improves performance.\nHow it works: The authors pretrained the 2-billion parameter BitNet b1.58, which has an architecture similar to LLaMA, on a dataset of 4 trillion tokens that included web data plus synthetic math problems. To strengthen its reasoning abilities, they fine-tuned it on chat data , instruction-following data , and synthetic instruction-following data. Finally, they fine-tuned the model via DPO to better match human preferences .\nDuring training, the authors used a quantized version of the model for forward passes and the non-quantized version for backward passes. Before each forward pass, they quantized the weights in linear layers to -1, 0, or +1. They ran the model, quantizing layer outputs to 8 bits. During backpropagation, they updated the weights of the non-quantized version, copied them, and quantized them before the next forward pass.\nFor ease of implementation, they ran attention, layer normalization, and other operations in 8-bit precision and stored the gradients and loss in 16 bits.\nThey used a two-phase schedule for the learning rate: an initial high learning rate helped BitNet b1.58 make updates large enough to affect the 1.58-bit weights after quantization — since small changes often had no effect — followed by a sharp drop in the learning rate mid-training to refine all weights on higher-quality data.\nSimilarly, they structured weight decay, which encourages weights to have lower values, in two phases. During the early phase, when the data quality was lower and learning rate higher, they used a strong decay to prevent overfitting. During the second phase, with higher-quality data and a lower learning rate, they disabled weight decay. This let all weights adapt to the data without interference from weight decay.\nResults: Across 16 popular benchmarks for language understanding, mathematical reasoning, and coding, BitNet b1.58 was faster and used less memory than competitors, including Alibaba’s Qwen2.5-1.5B, Google’s Gemma-3 1B, Hugging Face’s SmolLM2 1.7B, Meta’s Llama 3.2 1B, and ModelBest’s MiniCPM 2B. It achieved better performance than all except Qwen2.5 1.5B.\nRunning on a laptop, BitNet generated 34.5 tokens per second on average, whereas Qwen2.5-1.5B generated 15.4 tokens per second on average.\nBitNet’s memory requirement was 0.4GB, while Qwen2.5-1.5B required 2.6 GB.\nBitNet achieved average accuracy of 54.19 percent, while Qwen2.5-1.5B  achieved average accuracy of 55.23 percent. SmolLM2 1.7B was next-best (48.7 percent average accuracy).\nBitNet also outperformed a 4-bit quantized version of Qwen2.5-1.5B (52.15 percent average accuracy).\nWhy it matters: Quantizing an LLM to a few bits is not as simple as applying the current best practices for full-precision models. It demands rethinking LLM training, down to hyperparameter details like learning rate and weight decay. Even these seemingly small changes can have a large impact on final performance. By delving into these nuances, the authors provide a guide for how to ensure good performance from low-precision models.\nWe’re thinking: This work makes more than a bit of progress!\nA MESSAGE FROM RAPIDFIRE AI\nTired of waiting for hours to learn that your experiment didn’t work?

For centuries, the U.S. has welcomed immigrants, and this helped make it a worldwide leader in technology . Letting immigrants and native-born Americans collaborate makes everyone better off. Reversing this stance would have a huge negative impact on U.S. technology development.\nI was born in the UK and came to the U.S. on an F-1 student visa as a relatively unskilled and clueless teenager to attend college. Fortunately I gained skills and became less clueless over time. After completing my graduate studies, I started working at Stanford under the OPT (Optional Practical Training) program, and later an H-1B visa, and ended up staying here. Many other immigrants have followed similar paths to contribute to the U.S.\nI am very concerned that making visas harder to obtain for students and high-skilled workers, such as the pause in new visa interviews that started last month and a newly chaotic process of visa cancellations, will hurt our ability to attract great students and workers. In addition, many international students without substantial means count on being able to work under OPT to pay off the high cost of a U.S. college degree. Gutting the OPT program, as has been proposed , would both hurt many international students’ ability to study here and deprive U.S. businesses of great talent. (This won’t stop students from wealthy families. But the U.S. should try to attract the best talent without regard to wealth.)\nFailure to attract promising students and high-skilled workers would have a huge negative impact on American competitiveness in AI. Indeed, a recent report by the National Security Commission on Artificial Intelligence exhorts the government to “strengthen AI talent through immigration.”\nIf talented people do not come to the U.S., will they have an equal impact on global AI development just working somewhere else? Unfortunately, the net impact will be negative. The U.S. has a number of tech hubs including Austin, Boston/Cambridge, Los Angeles, New York, Pittsburgh, Seattle, and Silicon Valley, and these hubs concentrate talent and foster innovation. (This is why cities, where people can more easily find each other and collaborate, promote innovation .) Making it harder for AI talent to find each other and collaborate will slow down innovation, and it will take time for new hubs to become as advanced.\nNonetheless, other nations are working hard to attract immigrants who can drive innovation — a good move for them! Many have thoughtful programs to attract AI and other talent. There are the UK’s Global Talent Visa, France’s French Tech Visa, Australia’s Global Talent Visa, UAE’s Golden Visa, Taiwan’s Employment Gold Card, China’s Thousand Talents Plan, and many more. The U.S. is fortunate that many people already want to come here to study and work. Squandering that advantage would be a huge unforced error.\nBeyond the matter of national competitiveness, there is the even more important ethical matter of making sure people are treated decently. I have spoken with international students who are terrified that their visas may be canceled arbitrarily. One recently agonized about whether to attend an international conference to present a research paper, because they were worried about being unable to return. In the end, with great sadness, they cancelled their trip. I also spoke with a highly skilled technologist who is in the U.S. on an H-1B visa. Their company shut down, leading them — after over a decade in this country, and with few ties to their nation of origin — scrambling to find alternative employment that would enable them to stay.\nThese stories, and many far worse, are heartbreaking. While I do what I can to help individuals I know personally, it is tragic that we are creating such an uncertain environment for immigrants, that many people who have extraordinary skills and talents will no longer want to come here.\nTo every immigrant or migrant in the U.S. who is concerned about the current national environment: I see you and empathize with your worries. As an immigrant myself, I will be fighting to protect everyone’s dignity and right to due process, and to encourage legal immigration, which makes both the U.S. and individuals much better off.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nLearn to build with Meta’s Llama 4 models in this new short course! Work with the official Llama API, explore multimodal reasoning with image grounding, reason over long-context, and use tools for prompt optimization and synthetic data generation. Join in for free\nApple revamped two vision-language models in a bid to catch up with fast-moving competitors.\nWhat’s new: Apple updated the Apple Foundation Models (AFM) family, including smaller on-device and larger server-hosted versions, to improve their capabilities, speed, and efficiency. It also released the Foundation Models framework , an API that enables developers to call the on-device model on Apple devices that have Apple Intelligence enabled.\nInput/output: Text, images in (up to 65,000 tokens), text out\nArchitecture: AFM-on-device: 3 billion-parameter transformer, 300-million parameter vision transformer. AFM-server: custom mixture-of-experts transformer (parameter count undisclosed), 1 billion-parameter vision transformer.\nPerformance: Strong in non-U.S. English, image understanding\nAvailability: AFM-on-device for developers to use via Foundations Models framework, AFM-server not available for public use\nFeatures: Tool use, 15 languages, vision\nUndisclosed: Output token limit, AFM-server parameter count, details of training datasets, vision adapter architecture, evaluation protocol\nHow it works: Introduced last year, AFM models use a vision encoder to produce an image embedding, which a vision adapter modifies for the LLM. The LLM takes the modified image embedding and text prompt and generates a response. The team trained the systems to predict the next token, align embeddings produced by the vision encoder and LLM, and align responses with human feedback. They trained the models on text and image-text data from publicly available datasets, data scraped from the web, and data licensed from publishers.\nQuantization: The team used quantization aware training (simulating quantization during training to improve performance of the quantized model at inference) to compress AFM-on-device to 2 bits per weight (except for the embedding layer, which was compressed to 4 bits per weight). They used Adaptive Scalable Texture Compression , a method initially designed for graphics pipelines, to compress the AFM-server model to an average of 3.56 bits per weight (except for the embedding layer, which is compressed to 4 bits per weight).\nLoRA adapters: They trained LoRA adapters to recover performance loss due to compression, which adapted the model to specific tasks including summarization, proofreading, replying to  email, and answering questions.\nMoE architecture: While AFM-on-device uses a transformer architecture, AFM-server uses a custom mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture. A typical MoE can be viewed as splitting a portion of its fully connected layers into a number of parallel fully connected layers, of which it uses only a portion at inference. In comparison, the AFM-server’s MoE first splits the model into groups of layers, then it splits each group into parallel blocks. Each block is a separate multi-layer transformer outfitted with MoE layers (processed on a small number of hardware devices). While a typical MoE combines results across all devices at every mixture-of-experts layer, Apple’s architecture combines them only at the end of each block, which saves communication overhead during processing.\nPerformance: In human evaluations, the AFM models achieved mixed performance compared to selected models of similar or greater size. The tests included language tasks in U.S. English, non-U.S. English (including Canada and UK), and a basket of European and Asian languages.\nAFM-on-device: The on-device model performed better than the competitors at language tasks in non-U.S. English and image understanding. For instance, answering questions about images, AFM-on-device bested Qwen2.5-VL-3B more than 50 percent of the time and was judged worse 27 percent of the time.\nAFM-server: The server model’s performance was not decisively better than that of the competitors. For instance, AFM-server outperformed Qwen3-23B 25.8 percent of the time but was judged worse 23.7 percent of the time. It underperformed GPT-4o in all tests reported.\nBehind the news: Apple dominated social media last week with a controversial paper that purported to show that 5 state-of-the-art reasoning models couldn’t solve puzzles beyond a certain level of complexity.\nThe researchers prompted the models with four puzzles that allowed them to control complexity, including swapping the positions of red and blue checkers on a one-dimensional checkers board, Tower of Hanoi , River Crossing , and Blocks World . For all the puzzles and models, they found, the models’ performance fell to zero when the puzzles reached a certain degree of complexity (for example, a certain number of checkers to swap).\nA rebuttal paper quickly appeared, penned by Open Philanthropy senior program associate Alex Lawsen with help from Claude 4 Opus. Lawsen contended that Apple’s conclusions were unfounded because its tests included unsolvable puzzles, didn’t account for token output limits, and posed unrealistic criteria for judging outputs. However, he later posted a blog, “ When Your Joke Paper Goes Viral ,” in which he explained that he intended his paper as “obvious satire” of authors who use LLMs to write scientific papers, and that he hadn’t checked Claude 4 Opus’ output. He updated his paper to correct errors in the original version but maintained his fundamental critique.\nWhy it matters: Apple has been viewed as falling behind in AI. A promised upgrade of Siri, Apple’s AI assistant, is delayed indefinitely, and the lack of advanced AI features in new iPhones has led to a class-action lawsuit . Meanwhile, Google and its Android smartphone platform are racing ahead . The new models, especially the Foundation Models framework, look like a bid for a reset.\nWe’re thinking: Apple may be behind in AI, but its control over iOS is a huge advantage. If the operating system ships with a certain model and loads it into the limited memory by default, developers have a far greater incentive to use that model than an alternative. Limited memory on phones and the large size of good models make it impractical for many app developers to bundle models with their software, so if a model is favored by Apple (or Android), it’s likely to gain significant adoption for on-device uses.\nHollywood studios joined the record companies, publishers, and artists in the fight against companies that have trained AI models on their copyrighted works.\nWhat’s new: Disney and Universal sued Midjourney, accusing the image-generation startup of training its models on “countless” unauthorized copies of their copyrighted works and distributing images that depict characters the plaintiffs created.\nHow it works: Disney and Universal asked the court to order Midjourney to cease its alleged unauthorized distribution of their intellectual property. Further, they want Midjourney, which took in revenue of $300 million in 2024, to pay unspecified damages based on the claim that copyright law entitles them to $150,000 per infringed image. The studios accuse Midjourney of both direct infringement (that is, directly violating their copyrights by copying, displaying, or distributing their work without permission) and secondary infringement (enabling or encouraging direct infringement by others).\nThe lawsuit alleges that Midjourney reproduces copyrighted and derivative works, including the images of movie and television characters from Star Wars , Toy Story , Cars , Ironman , and The Simpsons .\nMidjourney generates such images even if users don’t ask for them explicitly. For instance, an image allegedly generated in response to the prompt, “Superhero fight scene,” includes Disney’s Spider-Man character.\nMidjourney is aware of the infringement, the studios claim, pointing out that Midjourney’s website includes infringing images in sections curated by the company.\nMidjourney could use software that would prevent its system from generating and distributing copyrighted material, the lawsuit says, citing other software products that identify copyrighted works automatically.\nThe filing alleges that Disney and Universal sent cease-and-desist letters to Midjourney, but the AI company didn’t stop producing and distributing images that infringe their copyrights.\nBehind the news: Copyright law is ambiguous on whether training AI systems on copyrighted works requires permission from the copyright holders, and several cases are winding their way through U.S. courts to answer this question. Starting in 2023, artists, authors, and publishers initiated legal actions against Alphabet, Meta, and OpenAI. Last year, some of the largest companies in the recording industry sued the AI music startups Suno and Udio. In February, a Delaware federal court issued the first major decision in this area, when a U.S. Circuit judge ruled that an AI-powered legal research service could not claim that training its models on writings produced by Thomson Reuters was a fair use because the resulting products competed with Thomson Reuters’ own products.\nWhy it matters: AI systems require enormous amounts of data. Historically, developers have felt free to use whatever copyrighted works they could find, typically online. As AI systems show greater potential to erode the market for human-made creative works — and to reproduce such works and create new works derived from them — owners of copyrighted material are looking for compensation as well as protection against this new form of competition. A single lawsuit won’t settle the issue, but this case, brought by two of the most powerful entertainment companies in the world, could set a precedent that strongly influences future lawsuits, the behavior of AI companies, and future legislation to update copyright for the AI era.\nWe’re thinking: Film studios and music labels once considered YouTube a copyright violator. Viacom, the entertainment company behind MTV and The Jersey Shore , once sued YouTube for copyright infringement. YouTube prevailed in two proceedings before the parties settled out of court, and YouTube subsequently improved its ability to detect and remove copyrighted works. Today, movie and recording companies rely on the enormously popular web video service to promote their wares. Given that history, Hollywood might consider partnering with AI companies instead of suing them. The pie would be bigger if Hollywood and AI companies worked together, although how to divide it would need to be worked out.\nOpenAI launched o3-pro, a more capable version of its most advanced reasoning vision-language model.\nWhat’s new: o3-pro is designed to respond to difficult challenges involving science, mathematics, and coding. But its reasoning firepower dramatically slows response times.\nInput/output: Text and images in (up to 200,000 tokens), text out (up to 100,000 tokens, 20.7 tokens per second, 129.2 seconds to first token )\nKnowledge cutoff: June 1, 2024\nFeatures: Function calling including web search, structured output\nAvailability/price: Available to ChatGPT Pro and Team users via OpenAI API, soon to Enterprise and Edu users, for $20/$80 per 1 million tokens of input/output\nUndisclosed: Details about architecture, training data, and training methods\nPerformance: o3-pro outperformed OpenAI’s own o3 (set to medium effort) and o1-pro in tests performed by OpenAI.\nSolving AIME 2024’s advanced high-school math competition problems on the first try, o3-pro (93 percent) bested o3 (90 percent) and o1-pro (86 percent).\nAnswering GPQA Diamond’s graduate-level science questions on the first try, o3-pro (85 percent) outperformed o3 (81 percent) and o1-pro (79 percent).\nCompleting Codeforces competition-coding problems in one pass, o3-pro (2748 CodeElo ) surpassed o3 (2517 CodeElo) and o1-pro (1707 CodeElo).\nIn qualitative tests, human reviewers consistently preferred o3-pro over o3 for queries related to scientific analysis (64.9 percent), personal writing (66.7 percent), computer programming (62.7 percent), and data analysis (64.3 percent).\nWhat they’re saying: Reviews of o3-pro so far generally are positive, but the model has been criticized for the time it takes to respond. Box CEO Aaron Levie commented that o3-pro is “crazy good at math and logic.” However, entrepreneur Yuchen Jin noted that it’s the “slowest and most overthinking model.”\nBehind the news: OpenAI rolled out o3-pro with a lower price, $20/$80 per 1 million input/output tokens, than o1-pro (which was priced at $150/$600 per 1 million input/output tokens but was deprecated in favor of the new model). Simultaneously it cut the price of o3 by 80 percent to $2/$8 per 1 million input/output tokens. These moves continue the plummeting price of inference over the past year. DeepSeek-R1 offers performance that approaches that of top models for $0.55/$2.19 per 1 million input/output tokens.\nWhy it matters: OpenAI is pushing the limits of current approaches to reasoning, and the results are promising if incremental. o3-pro’s extensive reasoning may appeal to developers who are working on the multi-step scientific problems. For many uses, though, the high price and slow speed may be a dealbreaker.\nWe’re thinking: Letting developers choose between o3 and o3-pro lets them calibrate their computational budget to the difficulty of the task at hand. What if we want to do the same with a trained, open-weights, large language model? Forcing an LLM to generate “Wait ” in its output causes it to keep thinking, and can improve its output significantly.\nIn Northern California, old property deeds may still include racial clauses: language, made illegal decades ago, that was designed to ban people of color from owning or living in certain homes. The state of California now requires counties to find and remove them, but manually combing through millions of documents would take years. Researchers used AI to find them automatically.\nWhat’s new: Faiz Surani, Mirac Suzgun, and colleagues at Stanford University and Princeton University fine-tuned a large language model to find racial clauses in deeds for property in the California county of Santa Clara.\nKey insight: Manual and keyword searches may fail to catch racial clauses if they’re obscured by subtle wording or errors in optical character recognition (OCR). But a fine-tuned large language model can understand context, identify relevant phrases, and avoid potential false alarms like the surnames Black or White. Lawyers can confirm the model’s findings.\nHow it works: The authors used an OCR system to extract text from 5.2 million pages of Santa Clara property deeds filed between 1850 and 1980. They drew examples from that corpus to form training and validation datasets and then processed the rest to find deeds that contained racial clauses.\nTo curate examples for training and validation, the authors started by sampling 20,000 pages at random. Since deeds have significant variation in format and quality, they added 10,000 deeds from other U.S. counties .\nThey filtered the combined examples using keywords that may indicate racial clauses, such as “Negro,” “Mongolian,” or “No person of,” yielding 3,801 pages.\nThey manually labeled the spans that included such language, which appeared on roughly 80 percent of those pages.\nThey fine-tuned Mistral-7B via LoRA on the labeled examples to learn to detect and reproduce discriminatory text.\nResults: The authors fed the remaining roughly 5.2 million unlabeled pages to the fine-tuned model. When the model identified a deed that contained a racial clause, county staff confirmed the finding and redacted the clause.\nThe authors found 24,500 Santa Clara lots covered by racial clauses — about one in four homes in the county in 1950.\nIt also revealed that 10 developers, out of what the authors estimate were hundreds, were responsible for one-third of the racial clauses, demonstrating that only a small number of actors shaped decades of segregation.\nThe fine-tuned model reviewed all pages in 6 days, which would cost an estimated $258 based on current prices for cloud access to GPUs. In contrast, few-shot prompting GPT-3.5 Turbo would have been faster (3.6 days) but less accurate and over 50 times more expensive ($13,634). Working manually, a single county staff member would have needed nearly 10 years and $1.4 million.\nWhy it matters: Large language models can interpret historical documents to reveal the nature and scope of actions in the past that otherwise would remain obscure — in this case, housing discrimination. By flagging discriminatory language, this work enables historians to identify areas affected by racial clauses and trace their broader social and economic effects. The team open-sourced the model, streamlining the process for other United States counties.\nWe’re thinking: While AI is making history, it’s also illuminating it!\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 305\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nThere’s a new breed of GenAI Application Engineers who can build more-powerful applications faster than was possible before, thanks to generative AI. Individuals who can play this role are highly sought-after by businesses, but the job description is still coming into focus. Let me describe their key skills, as well as the sorts of interview questions I use to identify them.\nSkilled GenAI Application Engineers meet two primary criteria: (i) They are able to use the new AI building blocks to quickly build powerful applications. (ii) They are able to use AI assistance to carry out rapid engineering, building software systems in dramatically less time than was possible before. In addition, good product/design instincts are a significant bonus.\nAI building blocks. If you own a lot of copies of only a single type of Lego brick, you might be able to build some basic structures. But if you own many types of bricks, you can combine them rapidly to form complex, functional structures. Software frameworks, SDKs, and other such tools are like that. If all you know is how to call a large language model (LLM) API, that's a great start. But if you have a broad range of building block types — such as prompting techniques, agentic frameworks, evals, guardrails, RAG, voice stack, async programming, data extraction, embeddings/vectorDBs, model fine tuning, graphDB usage with LLMs, agentic browser/computer use, MCP, reasoning models, and so on — then you can create much richer combinations of building blocks.\nThe number of powerful AI building blocks continues to grow rapidly. But as open-source contributors and businesses make more building blocks available, staying on top of what is available helps you keep on expanding what you can build. Even though new building blocks are created, many building blocks from 1 to 2 years ago (such as eval techniques or frameworks for using vectorDBs) are still very relevant today.\nAI-assisted coding. AI-assisted coding tools enable developers to be far more productive, and such tools are advancing rapidly. Github Copilot, first announced in 2021 (and made widely available in 2022), pioneered modern code autocompletion. But shortly after, a new breed of AI-enabled IDEs such as Cursor and Windsurf offered much better code-QA and code generation. As LLMs improved, these AI-assisted coding tools that were built on them improved as well.\nNow we have highly agentic coding assistants such as OpenAI’s Codex and Anthropic’s Claude Code (which I really enjoy using and find impressive in its ability to write code, test, and debug autonomously for many iterations). In the hands of skilled engineers — who don’t just “vibe code” but deeply understand AI and software architecture fundamentals and can steer a system toward a thoughtfully selected product goal — these tools make it possible to build software with unmatched speed and efficiency.\nI find that AI-assisted coding techniques become obsolete much faster than AI building blocks, and techniques from 1 or 2 years ago are far from today's best practices. Part of the reason for this might be that, while AI builders might use dozens (hundreds?) of different building blocks, they aren’t likely to use dozens of different coding assistance tools at once, and so the forces of Darwinian competition are stronger among tools. Given the massive investments in this space by  Anthropic, Google, OpenAI, and other players, I expect the frenetic pace of development to continue, but keeping up with the latest developments in AI-assisted coding tools will pay off, since each generation is much better than the last.\nBonus: Product skills. In some companies, engineers are expected to take pixel-perfect drawings of a product, specified in great detail, and write code to implement it. But if a product manager has to specify even the smallest detail, this slows down the team. The shortage of AI product managers exacerbates this problem. I see teams move much faster if GenAI Engineers also have some user empathy as well at basic skill at designing products, so that, given only high-level guidance on what to build (“a user interface that lets users see their profiles and change their passwords”), they can make a lot of decisions themselves and build at least a prototype to iterate from.\nWhen interviewing GenAI Application Engineers, I will usually ask about their mastery of AI building blocks and ability to use AI-assisted coding, and sometimes also their product/design instincts. One additional question I've found highly predictive of their skill is, “How do you keep up with the latest developments in AI?” Because AI is evolving so rapidly, someone with good strategies for keeping up — such as reading The Batch and taking short courses 😃, regular hands-on practice building projects, and having a community to talk to — really does stay ahead of the game much better than those who have less-effective strategies (such as if social media were their main source of info about AI, which typically does not provide the depth needed to keep up).\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nThe Data Analytics Professional Certificate is fully launched!

You’ll also receive guidance to build your portfolio and land a job in data analysis. Sign up\nSame character, new background, new action. That’s the focus of the latest text-to-image models from Germany’s Black Forest Labs.\nWhat’s new: The FLUX.1 Kontext family, which comes in versions dubbed max, pro, and dev, is trained to alter images in controlled ways. The company plans to release the weights for FLUX.1 Kontext dev but has not yet specified the licensing terms.\nInput/output: text, image in; image out\nArchitecture: Unspecified text encoders, convolutional neural network image encoder-decoder, transformer. FLUX.1 Kontext dev 12 billion parameters, other parameter counts undisclosed\nFeatures: Character consistency, local and global alterations\nAvailability/price: FLUX.1 Kontext max and FLUX.1 Kontext pro available via FLUX Playground and various partners, $0.08 per image (FLUX.1 max) and $0.04 per image (FLUX.1 pro) via Fal , an image-generation platform.\nUndisclosed: Parameter counts of FLUX.1 Kontext max and FLUX.1 Kontext pro, architecture of text encoders, training data, evaluation protocol, open-weights license\nHow it works: The FLUX.1 Kontext models include encoders that embed input text and/or images, a transformer that processes them, and an image decoder that generates images. The current technical report doesn’t describe how it trained them for character consistency and image editing.\nThe team trained the convolutional neural network encoder-decoder to reproduce images and to fool a discriminator (architecture and training unspecified) into classifying them as real.\nHaving frozen the encoders, they trained the transformer — given a time step, embedding of a text prompt, embedding of a reference image, and noisy image embedding — to remove the noise over a series of steps.\nThey further trained the transformer to encourage it to produce noise-free embeddings that a second discriminator would classify as representing real images. This process, a variant of adversarial diffusion distillation , helps reduce the number of steps needed to produce a good image embedding.\nResults: The team compared the output of FLUX.1 Kontext models with that of five competing models including OpenAI GPT Image 1 (at three different quality levels) and Google Gemini 2.0 Flash native image generation . An undisclosed number of people evaluated the models according to a proprietary benchmark that highlights altering local and global aspects of an image, editing generated text within an image, maintaining consistent characters, and generating an image according to a reference style. The dataset included roughly 1,000 crowd-sourced pairs of text prompts and reference images.\nFLUX.1 Kontext max and FLUX.1 Kontext pro outperformed all competing models.\nFLUX.1 dev outperformed all except other family members and GPT Image 1 set to high or medium quality.\nBehind the news: Character consistency, also known as personalization, has come a long way since text-to-image generators became popular. In 2022, Textual Inversion showed how to learn an embedding of a character and use that embedding to produce further images. In 2023, DreamBooth showed how to get good results by fine-tuning a model on a few images of the character to be portrayed in a new situation. Since then, image-editing models have improved in quality and generality, including Meta Emu-Edit , OmniGen , and OpenAI gpt-image-1.\nWhy it matters: Consistency and precise editing enable artists to craft stories around specific characters. Such models have become better at generating consistent details across images, but they remain finicky, sometimes changing minute details or entire characters and backgrounds. The more faithfully they help users express their ideas, the more firmly embedded in the creative toolkit they’ll become.\nWe’re thinking: Black Forest Labs announced plans to publish its proprietary benchmark. There’s a real need for common benchmarks to evaluate image generation, and we hope other developers will give it due consideration.\nRenowned investment analyst Mary Meeker is back with a report on the AI market, six years after publishing her last survey of the internet.\nWhat’s new: Meeker, co-founder of the venture capital firm Bond who formerly analyzed technology portfolios for Merrill Lynch, Salomon Brothers, and Morgan Stanley, published “ Trends — Artificial Intelligence (May ‘25) .” The report, which spans 340 graph-packed pages, revives and updates a series that chronicled the rise of the internet nearly every year from 1995 through 2019.\nHow it works: The new report focuses on a handful of themes that arise from the unprecedented growth and capabilities of deep learning. As Meeker told Axios , AI is an arena for “intense competition the likes of which we’ve never seen before,” and that makes the present time “a period for lots of wealth creation and wealth destruction.”\nRapid growth: Change in AI is happening faster than ever. Users of ChatGPT reached 1 million in 5 days — compared to the iPhone’s 74 days — and since then have rocketed to 800 million. Total capital expenditures of the six biggest technology companies (largely driven by AI) rose 63 percent to $212 billion between 2023 and 2024. Training datasets are growing 260 percent per year, processing power devoted to training is growing 360 percent per year, effective processing power is growing at 200 percent annually.\nRevenues and costs: The economics of this new world are not straightforward. On one hand, revenue is soaring at giants like Amazon, Google, and Nvidia as well as startups like Scale AI. On the other hand, the cost of computation is rising steadily even as the cost per token of output falls precipitously. Meanwhile, rapid turnover of models and proliferation of open-source alternatives are wild cards for AI-powered businesses.\nRising performance: AI performance continues to increase. AI’s ability to complete the MMLU benchmark of language understanding outstripped human performance last year. This year, 73 percent of human testers classified responses generated by an LLM as human, according to one study. Synthetic images, video, and speech generation — all are increasingly capable of fooling human testers.\nEmerging capabilities: Today’s AI is capable of writing and editing, tutoring, brainstorming, automating repetitive work, and providing companionship. Within five years, it will generate code as well as humans, create films and games, operate humanlike robots, and drive scientific discovery. Meeker forecasts that within 10 years, AI will conduct scientific research, design advanced technologies, and build immersive digital worlds.\nWorkforce implications: Industries most likely to be affected by AI include knowledge work, content creation, legal services, software development, financial services, customer service, drug discovery, and manufacturing. Employers are adopting AI to get a boost in workforce productivity that Stanford researchers estimate is an average 14 percent. Companies like Box, Duolingo, and Shopify are adopting an AI-first orientation, while AI-related job titles have risen 200 percent in the past two years.\nAI gets physical: AI is having a profound impact on the physical world. Lyft’s and Uber’s market share fell around 15 percent while Waymo’s gained 27 percent over the past 18 months. AI-driven mineral exploration is boosting mine efficiency, and AI-powered agriculture is cutting the use of pesticides. And, sadly, AI-equipped attack drones are wreaking destruction upon Ukraine and elsewhere, even as they play a critical role in defense.\nBehind the news: Meeker published her first “Internet Trends” report in 1995, anticipating the coming online boom, and she issued new editions annually throughout the 2000s and much of the coming decade. Her final internet report arrived in 2019, the year after she founded Bond, when the report highlighted the rise of visual social media like Instagram, wearable technology, and digital payments.\nWhy it matters: “Trends — Artificial Intelligence” offers a wealth of market data culled from analyst reports, consumer surveys, and academic studies. The AI community has a number of excellent annual surveys, including Stanford’s AI Index and Air Street Capital’s State of AI . Meeker, who has been watching technology markets since the dawning of the web, adds another valuable perspective.\nWe’re thinking: One implication of the report: There has never been a better time to build software applications. For developers, it’s time to hone and update skills. For tech companies, it’s time to cast the net for talent. As Meeker said in her interview with Axios , “Companies that get the best developers often win.”\nAn independent AI test lab detailed the rising cost of benchmarking reasoning models.\nWhat’s new: Artificial Analysis, an organization that tracks model performance and cost, revealed its budgets for evaluating a few recent models that improve their output by producing chains of thought, which use extra computation and thus boost the cost of inference. The expense is making it difficult for startups, academic labs, and other organizations that have limited resources to reproduce results reported by model developers, TechCrunch reported . (Disclosure: Andrew Ng is an investor in Artificial Analysis.)\nHow it works: Artificial Analysis tested reasoning and non-reasoning models on popular benchmarks that gauge model performance in responding to queries that require specialized knowledge or multi-step reasoning, solving math problems, generating computer programs, and the like.\nRunning a group of seven popular benchmarks, OpenAI o1 (which produces chains of thought) produced more than 44 million tokens, while GPT-4o (which doesn’t take explicit reasoning steps) produced around 5.5 million tokens.\nBenchmarking o1 cost $2,767, while benchmarking Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet (which allows users to allocate a number of reasoning tokens per query; TechCrunch doesn’t provide the number in this case) cost $1,485. Smaller reasoning models are significantly less expensive: o3-mini (at high effort, which uses the highest number of reasoning tokens per query) cost $345, and o1-mini cost $141.\nNon-reasoning models are less expensive to test. Evaluating GPT-4o cost $109, Claude 3.5 Sonnet was $81.\nArtificial Analysis spent around $5,200 to test 12 reasoning models versus around $2,400 to test more than 80 non-reasoning models.\nBehind the news: Generally, the cost per token of using AI models has been falling even as their performance has been rising. However, two factors complicate that trend. (i) Reasoning models produce more tokens and thus cost more to run, and (ii) developers are charging higher per-token prices to use their latest models. For example, o1-pro and GPT-4.5 (a non-reasoning model), both released in early 2025, cost $600 per million output tokens, while Claude 3.5 Sonnet (released in July 2024) costs $15 per million tokens of output. Emerging techniques that allow users to allocate numbers of tokens to reasoning (whether “high” or “low” or a specific tally) also make benchmarking more costly and complicated.\nWhy it matters: Benchmarks aren’t entirely sufficient for evaluating models, but they are a critical indicator of relative performance, and independent benchmarking helps to ensure that tests are run in a fair and consistent way. As the cost of benchmarking climbs, fewer labs are likely to confirm or challenge results obtained by the original developer, making it harder to compare models and recognize progress.\nWe’re thinking: Verifying performance claims in independent, open, fair tests is essential to marking progress in general and choosing the right models for particular projects. It's time for the industry to support independent benchmarking organizations.\nResearchers reduced the number of tokens needed to represent video frames to be fed to a transformer.\nWhat’s new: Jindong Jiang, Xiuyu Li, and collaborators at Nvidia, Rutgers University, UC Berkeley, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Nanjing University, and Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology built STORM , a text-video system that performs well in tests of video understanding while processing fewer tokens.\nKey insight: In a multimodal system, a large language model (LLM) that receives video tokens may struggle to process long videos. However, sequences of video frames often contain lots of redundancy, since few pixels may change from one frame to the next. Instead of forcing the LLM to process long sequences of redundant video tokens, mamba layers can enrich the token embeddings that represent one frame with information from other frames in the same clip. That way, the system can average token embeddings across frames without losing crucial information, making it possible to feed fewer tokens to the LLM without compromising performance.\nHow it works: The authors built STORM by training three components: (1) a pretrained SigLIP vision transformer, (2) untrained mamba layers, and (3) the pretrained large language model (LLM) from Qwen2-VL . They trained the system to predict the next token in image - text pairs and video-text pairs with 32-frame videos , and video-text pairs with 128-frame videos .\nSigLIP learned to turn each video frame into 256 image tokens.\nGiven a sequence of image tokens, mamba layers learned to process them in both directions – left-to-right and right-to-left – so each output token embedding encoded information from the entire video.\nThe system averaged the token embeddings of 4 consecutive frames, reducing by a factor of 4 the number of tokens processed by Qwen2-VL’s LLM.\nGiven the averaged token embeddings, Qwen2-VL LLM learned to predict the next word in the video’s associated text.\nAt inference, the system fed to the LLM the tokens that represented every second frame (a process the authors call temporal sampling), which further halved the input to the LLM.\nResults: STORM outperformed proprietary and open models on measures of video understanding.\nOn MVBench , which asks multiple-choice questions about actions, object interactions, and scene transitions in 16-second videos, STORM achieved 70.6 percent accuracy. That’s better than GPT-4o (64.6 percent accuracy) and Qwen2-VL (67.0 percent accuracy). A baseline system (STORM’s SigLIP and Qwen2-VL LLM without mamba layers, averaging image tokens, and temporal sampling) achieved 69.5 percent.\nOn MLVU , which asks multiple-choice and open-ended questions about videos that range from 3 minutes to over 2 hours long, STORM reached 72.9 percent accuracy, topping GPT-4o (66.2 percent accuracy). The baseline model achieved 70.2 percent.\nWhy it matters: STORM compresses video at the input to the LLM, so the LLM processes 1/8 as many video tokens and uses 1/8 as much compute to process them. This enables the system to work more than 3 times faster than the baseline while performing better.\nWe’re thinking: Initial work on the mamba architecture positioned it as a replacement for the transformer, but this work, along with other projects , combines them to get the benefits of both.\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn “Orchestrating Workflows for GenAI Applications” you’ll learn to orchestrate generative AI workflows using Apache Airflow 3.0.

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 304\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nEveryone can benefit by learning to code with AI! At AI Fund, the venture studio I lead, everyone — not just the engineers — can vibe code or use more sophisticated AI-assisted coding techniques. This empowers everyone to build with AI. The impact on team creativity and productivity has been exciting! I share my experience with this in the hope that more teams will invest in empowering everyone to build with AI.\nEveryone at AI Fund who was not already an engineer started with our “ AI Python for Beginners ” course to learn the basics. I also shared with the team details of the tech stack I use to give everyone a default set of building blocks. Since then, many have gone on to acquire additional building blocks (such as additional third-party APIs) themselves either by taking courses , searching online, or learning from colleagues.\nYou can watch a video of our experience with this here .\nHere are just a few examples of applications that non-engineers at AI Fund have built:\nOur CFO Ellen Li built an app that scans our Google docs system to flag updates to a portfolio company’s information, saving what was previously 5 to 6 hours of manual work per week.\nSenior Executive Recruiter Jon Zemmelman built a system that lets him configure the relative ratings of screening criteria for job candidates (such as previous startup experience, technical expertise, etc.) and automatically evaluate resumes against the criteria.\nAssociate General Counsel Nikhil Sharma wrote code to automatically generate NDAs (non-disclosure agreements) in AI Fund’s standard template.\nOffice Coordinator Ellie Jenkins, as a fun project, built a visualization of the history of fashion design houses and their influence on each other.\nIt is very empowering when individuals don’t have to try to get scarce engineering resources allocated to their ideas in order to try them out. There are a lot fewer gatekeepers in the way: If someone has an idea, they can build a prototype and try it out. If it gets positive feedback from users, that lays the groundwork for scaling it up. Or, if the prototype does not work, this is also valuable information that lets them quickly move on to a different idea or take insights from critical feedback to decide what to try next.\nIn the future, one of the most important skills in any profession will be the ability to tell a computer exactly what you want, so the computer can do it for you. For the foreseeable future, writing code (with AI assistance, so the AI, rather than you, actually writes the code) will be the best way to do this.\nThis is a great time for everyone to code with AI!\nKeep building,\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn “DSPy: Build and Optimize Agentic Apps,” you’ll learn to use Databricks’ DSPy framework to structure, debug, and improve the accuracy of agentic workflows.

Enroll now\nDeepSeek updated its groundbreaking DeepSeek-R1 large language model to strike another blow for open-weights performance.\nWhat’s new: The new DeepSeek-R1-0528 surpasses its predecessor and approaches the performance of OpenAI o3 and Google Gemini-2.5 Pro. A smaller version, DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B , runs on a single GPU with as little as 40GB VRAM, according to TechCrunch .\nInput/output: Text in (up to 64,000 tokens), text out (up to 64,000 tokens)\nArchitecture: DeepSeek-R1-0528 mixture-of-experts transformer, 685 billion parameters (upgraded from 671 billion), 37 billion active at any given time; DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B transformer\nFeatures: JSON output, tool use\nAvailability/price: Both models free via Hugging Face for noncommercial and commercial uses under MIT License , DeepSeek-R1-0528 available via DeepSeek’s app by entering the conversation interface and turning on Deep Thinking, DeepSeek API $0.14/$2.19 per 1 million tokens of input/output ($0.035/$0.55 per 1 million tokens of input/output from 4:30 P.M. to 12:30 A.M. Pacific Time)\nUndisclosed: Fine-tuning data and methods\nHow it works: DeepSeek released little information so far about how it built the new models.\nLike the original DeepSeek-R1 , DeepSeek-R1-0528 is a fine-tuned version of DeepSeek-V3 from late 2024. It was exposed to further “algorithmic optimization mechanisms during post-training” and consumes more tokens at inference.\nDeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B is based on Qwen3-8B with reasoning knowledge distilled from DeepSeek-R1-0528.\nPerformance: DeepSeek-R1-0528 nips at the heels of top closed LLMs on a variety of benchmarks, while DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B raises the bar for LLMs in its 8-billion-parameter size class. DeepSeek claims general improvements in reasoning, managing complex tasks, and writing and editing lengthy prose, along with 50 percent fewer hallucinations when rewriting and summarizing.\nDeepSeek-R1-0528 improves on the previous version dramatically in some cases. In DeepSeek’s tests, it achieved 17.7 percent of the reasoning problems in HLE compared to the previous version's 8.5 percent. On Aider, it achieved 71.6 percent accuracy compared to the previous version's 53.3 percent accuracy, and it made a similar improvement on AIME 2025 (math) — although it consumed nearly twice as many tokens.\nOn AIME 2024 and AIME 2025 (high-school math competition problems) as well as LiveCodeBench (coding challenges), DeepSeek-R1-0528 performed ahead of Gemini-2.5 Pro-0506 but behind o3. On GPQA Diamond (graduate-level knowledge in a variety of domains), Aider (programming tasks), and HLE (reasoning), it fell behind both Gemini-2.5 Pro-0506 and o3.\nDeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B excelled on AIME 2025, where it achieved 76.3 percent, ahead of the much larger Qwen3-32B (72.9 percent) and just behind o3-mini set to medium effort (76.7 percent). It did less well on GPQA, underperforming the other models reported by DeepSeek, and LiveCodeBench, where it fell behind Gemini 2.5-Flash-Thinking-0520.\nBehind the news: The initial version of DeepSeek-R1 challenged the belief that building top-performing AI models requires tens to hundreds of millions of dollars, top-of-the-line GPUs, and enormous numbers of GPU hours. For the second time in less than a year, DeepSeek has built a competitive LLM with a relatively low budget.\nWhy it matters: DeepSeek’s models, along with Alibaba’s Qwen series, continue to narrow the gap between open-weights models and their closed peers. Its accomplishments could lead to wider adoption of less-expensive, more-efficient approaches. DeepSeek is passing along the cost savings to developers, offering high-performance inference at a fraction of the cost of closed models.\nWe’re thinking: DeepSeek-R1-0528-Qwen3-8B mixes contributions from open-weight models — possible only because Qwen3’s license, like DeepSeek’s is permissive. Open models enable experimentation and innovation in ways that closed models do not.\nAI is bringing a massive boost in productivity to Duolingo, maker of the most popular app for learning languages.\nWhat’s new: Duolingo used generative AI to produce 148 courses, more than doubling its previous catalog. The technology enabled the company to offer some of its most popular courses — Spanish, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin — in 28 languages. Initially, the company is using AI to produce courses aimed at beginners, with more advanced levels to come.\nHow it works: Duolingo’s AI-assisted approach to building language courses quickly turns a single course into many. The new approach revved its pace from building 100 courses over 12 years to producing many more than that in less than a year.\nDuolingo starts by building a base course and uses AI to translate it into numerous languages. For example, it can adapt a course that enables English speakers to learn French into a course for Mandarin speakers.\nThe new process gives the company more flexibility in allocating resources, Duolingo’s head of AI Klinton Bicknell told Bloomberg . Previously, the company could dedicate a team to either creating new high-demand courses or updating an existing course. Now it can do both.\nThe quicker pace will enable the company to meet rising demand for instruction in Asian languages such as Japanese, Korean, and Mandarin.\nBehind the scenes: AI is at the heart of Duolingo’s expansion into other areas beyond language learning.\nDuolingo has used OpenAI models to build curricula since 2023. However, it is evaluating models from Anthropic and Google as well as open options.\nFollowing one test, Duolingo concluded that Anthropic’s Claude was “much better” at generating certain types of math content for the company’s relatively new math curriculum, according to Bicknell.\nThe company’s embrace of AI drew criticism last week after CEO Luis von Ahn recently posted on LinkedIn that it would stop hiring contractors to do work that could be automated and increase staffing only in areas that couldn’t be automated. Since then, Duolingo has noted that it plans to hire more engineers and AI researchers, and employees will generate data used to train AI instead of performing quality reviews and other jobs that AI can do faster.\nWhy it matters: Companies in nearly every industry face pressure to produce more with less amid rising competition. AI can help to accomplish that while potentially improving product quality, and Duolingo has ample reason to move aggressively in this direction. The startup Speak , which offers a voice-based approach to learning languages, is growing rapidly, and Google just launched Little Language Lessons that show how an AI-first product could be used as a language teacher and conversational partner.\nWe’re thinking: AI is well on the way to transforming education for teachers, students, and technology companies!\nAI’s thirst for energy is growing, but the technology also could help produce huge energy savings over the next five to 10 years, according to a recent report.\nWhat’s new: The International Energy Agency (IEA), which advises 44 countries on energy policy, performed a comprehensive analysis of AI’s energy consumption including energy required to obtain critical materials needed for chips and data centers. The report sees dark clouds ahead but also silver linings.\nDark clouds: The report, which is based on interviews with officials in government, energy, and technology, makes four projections for AI’s energy consumption. In the base scenario, future growth and efficiency gains are similar to those of the past five years. The agency also plots a “take-off” scenario in which AI adoption happens faster, a “high efficiency” scenario with lower energy needs, and a “headwinds” scenario in which adoption of AI slows or infrastructure bottlenecks impede construction. Among the conclusions:\nDemand for electricity by data centers worldwide will more than double by 2030 in the base scenario, growing from 415 terawatt-hours (TWh) today to 945 TWh, around 2.5 percent of current global energy consumption. By 2035, this figure will range from 700 TWh to 1700 TWh.\nBy 2030, data centers outfitted with AI accelerator chips will consume four times the energy they do today.\nThe United States, China, and Europe have more data centers (and use more electricity) than the rest of the world. Like many countries, their data centers are in a few geographic regions, drawing from the same power sources, which eventually will strain local electrical grids. Together, the U.S. and China will account for 80 percent of global growth in data center electricity consumption by 2030. Japan and Malaysia will also see strong growth.\nSilver linings: AI already makes energy generation, distribution, and use more efficient. The authors expect these savings to accelerate.\nExisting AI algorithms predict energy generation and consumption. This makes it easier to integrate renewable energy sources into the grid, which reduces reliance on fossil fuels and cuts the resulting pollutants and greenhouse gases. Extending existing programs to increase use of renewables by 1 percent would reduce CO2 emissions by 120 megatons by 2035, which is roughly 40 percent of the projected emissions attributable to data centers.\nWidespread adoption of existing AI applications that streamline energy consumption in industry, transportation, and buildings could reduce CO2 emissions by 1.4 gigatons, nearly five times the projected emissions attributable to data centers, by 2035. For example, scaling up existing AI optimization of heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning systems would save 300 TWh, about one-third of total energy used by data centers.\nAI and cloud-computing companies continue to negotiate long-term purchase agreements that can secure renewable and zero-emissions energy for as much as 20 years. Data center operators are responsible for most of the long-term contracts that have been announced, nearly all of them for solar energy. Consequently, renewables generation is projected to grow by over 450 TWh by 2035.\nThe energy costs of training, inference, and cooling hardware are expected to fall further thanks to trends in AI models (fewer parameters, more efficient algorithms, task-specific models) hardware (more energy-efficient chips, improved cooling methods), and usage (batch processing, running smaller models locally rather than in the cloud).\nYes, but: The authors concede that lower energy costs for AI likely will lead to much greater consumption — according to the Jevons paradox — so more-efficient models and hardware will result in higher energy consumption overall.\nBehind the news: Data centers were growing rapidly prior to the boom in generative AI. Data centers’ electricity use doubled between 2000 and 2005 and again between 2017 and 2022, driven by the growth of cloud computing and data storage, streaming and social media, and cryptocurrency mining. However, these periods of accelerating growth were followed by periods of slower growth as efforts to cut costs led to more-efficient software and hardware. The authors expect this pattern to hold.\nWhy it matters: The IEA report is a first-of-its-kind analysis of AI’s energy requirements, how they’re likely to grow, as well as the potential of the technology itself to reduce those requirements. It confirms that AI is poised to consume huge amounts of energy. However, it also suggests that today’s energy costs will be tomorrow’s energy savings as AI makes energy generation, distribution, and use more efficient across a wide variety of industries.\nWe’re thinking: While demand for electricity for data centers is growing rapidly, calibrating the right level of investment is tricky. High levels of growth come with high levels of hype that can lead analysts to overestimate future demand. For example, Microsoft, after examining its forecasts, canceled data-center projects that would have consumed 2 gigawatts.\nResearchers identified a simple way to mislead autonomous agents based on large language models.\nWhat’s new : Ang Li and colleagues at Columbia University developed a method to exploit the implicit trust that agents tend to place in popular websites by poisoning those websites with malicious links.\nKey insight : Commercially available agentic systems may not trust random sites on the web, but they tend to trust popular sites such as social-media sites. An attacker can exploit this trust by crafting seemingly typical posts that link to a malicious website. The agent might follow the link, mistakenly extending its trust to an untrustworthy site.\nHow it works : The authors tested web-browsing agents including Anthropic Computer Use and MultiOn on tasks such as shopping or sending emails.\nThe authors created Reddit posts that aligned thematically with a particular agentic task, such as shopping for Air Jordan 1 shoes. The posts contained text akin to marketing (for example, “Where to Buy Air Jordan 1 Chicago”) as well as instructions that pointed to a malicious site controlled by the authors (“for more information, check out <website>”).\nThe authors fed a query like “Where can I buy Nike Air Jordan 1 in Chicago?” to the agent. They also entered sensitive information like credit card details or email credentials.\nThe agent searched the web for resources needed to fulfill the query. It examined sites and found the Reddit posts written by the authors.\nThe agent followed the instructions in the posts and visited the malicious website. The website included instructions that manipulated the agent to pursue an attacker’s goal, such as submitting credit card information or sending phishing emails from the user’s email address.\nResults : Once an agent was redirected to the malicious websites, it reliably followed the attacker’s instructions. For example, each of the agents tested divulged credit card information in 10 out of 10 trials. Similarly, each agent sent a phishing message from the user’s email account asking recipients to send money to a malicious “friend” in 10 out of 10 trials.\nWhy it matters : Giving agents the ability to perform real-world actions, such as executing purchases and sending emails, raises the possibility that they might be tricked into taking harmful actions. Manipulating agents by referring them to malicious web content is an effective vector of attack. Agents will be more secure if they’re designed to avoid and resist such manipulation.\nWe’re thinking: Humans, too, can be fooled by phishing and other malicious activities, and the path to programming agents to defend against them seems easier than the path to training the majority of humans to do so. In the long term, agents will make online interactions safer.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 303\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nI am alarmed by the proposed cuts to U.S. funding for basic research, analyzed here , and the impact this would have for U.S. competitiveness in AI and other areas. Funding research that is openly shared benefits the whole world, but the nation it benefits most is the one where the research is done.\nIf not for funding for my early work in deep learning from the National Science Foundation (NSF)  and Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA), which disburse much of U.S. research funding, I would not have discovered lessons about scaling that led me to pitch starting Google Brain to scale up deep learning. I am worried that cuts to funding for basic science will lead the U.S. — and also the world — to miss out on the next set of ideas.\nIn fact, such funding benefits the U.S. more than any other nation.  Scientific research brings the greatest benefit to the country where the work happens because (i) the new knowledge diffuses fastest within that country, and (ii) the process of doing research creates new talent for that nation.\nWhy does most innovation in generative AI still happen in Silicon Valley? Because two teams based in this area — Google Brain, which invented the transformer network, and OpenAI, which scaled it up — did a lot of the early work. Subsequently, team members moved to other nearby businesses, started competitors, or worked with local universities. Further, local social networks rapidly diffused the knowledge through casual coffee meetings, local conferences, and even children’s play dates, where parents of like-aged kids meet and discuss technical ideas. In this way, the knowledge spread faster within Silicon Valley than to other geographies.\nIn a similar vein, research done in the U.S. diffuses to others in the U.S. much faster than to other geographic areas. This is particularly true when the research is openly shared through papers and/or open source: If researchers have permission to talk about an idea, they can share much more information, such as tips and tricks for how to really make an algorithm work, more quickly. It also lets others figure out faster who can answer their questions. Diffusion of knowledge created in academic environments is especially fast. Academia tends to be completely open, and students and professors, unlike employees of many companies, have full permission to talk about their work.\nThus funding basic research in the U.S. benefits the U.S. most, and also benefits our allies. It is true that openness benefits our adversaries, too. But as a subcommittee of the U.S. House of Representatives committee on science, space, and technology points out , “... open sharing of fundamental research is [not] without risk. Rather, ... openness in research is so important to competitiveness and security that it warrants the risk that adversaries may benefit from scientific openness as well.”\nFurther, generative AI is evolving so rapidly that staying on the cutting edge is what’s really critical. For example, the fact that many teams can now train a model with GPT-3.5- or even GPT-4-level capability does not seem to be hurting OpenAI much, which is busy growing its business by developing the cutting-edge o4, Codex, GPT-4.1, and so on. Those who invent a technology get to commercialize it first, and in a fast-moving world, the cutting-edge technology is what’s most valuable. Studies like this one (albeit done while the internet was not as prevalent as it is today) also show how knowledge diffuses locally much faster than globally.\nChina was decisively behind the U.S. in generative AI when ChatGPT was first launched in 2022. However, China’s tech ecosystem is very open internally, and this has helped it to catch up over the past two years:\nThere is ample funding for open academic research in China.\nChina’s businesses such as DeepSeek and Alibaba have released cutting-edge, open-weights models. This openness at the corporate level accelerates diffusion of knowledge.\nChina’s labor laws make non-compete agreements (which stop an employee from jumping ship to a competitor) relatively hard to enforce, and the work culture supports significant idea sharing among employees of different companies; this has made circulation of ideas relatively efficient.\nWhile there’s also much about China that I would not seek to emulate, the openness of its tech ecosystem has helped it accelerate.\nIn 1945, Vannevar Bush’s landmark report “ Science, The Endless Frontier ” laid down key principles for public funding of U.S. research and talent development. Those principles enabled the U.S. to dominate scientific progress for decades. U.S. federal funding for science created numerous breakthroughs that have benefited the U.S. tremendously, and also the world, while training generations of domestic scientists, as well as immigrants who likewise benefit the U.S.\nThe good news is that this playbook is now well known. I hope many more nations will imitate it and invest heavily in science and talent. And I hope that, having pioneered this very successful model, the U.S. will not pull back from it by enacting drastic cuts to funding scientific research.\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI AND SNOWFLAKE\nWe’re featured partners of Snowflake’s Dev Day 2025, a full day for AI and data practitioners to explore cutting-edge demos, make valuable contacts, and hear from top voices in the field (including Andrew Ng). See you on June 5! Register here\nAnthropic continued its tradition of building AI models that raise the bar in coding tasks.\nWhat’s new: Anthropic launched Claude 4 Sonnet 4 and Claude Opus 4 , the latest medium- and largest-size members of its family of general-purpose large language models. Both models offer an optional reasoning mode and can use multiple tools in parallel while reasoning. In addition, the company made generally available Claude Code, a coding agent previously offered as a research preview, along with a Claude Code software development kit.\nInput/output: Text, images, PDF files in (up to 200,000 tokens); text out (Claude Sonnet 4 up to 64,000 tokens, Claude Opus 4 up to 32,000 tokens)\nFeatures: Parallel tool use including computer use, selectable reasoning mode with visible reasoning tokens, multilingual (15 languages)\nPerformance: Ranked Number One in LMSys WebDev Arena, state-of-the-art on SWE-bench and Terminal-bench\nAvailability/price: Anthropic API, Amazon Bedrock, Google Cloud Vertex AI. Claude Sonnet 4 $3/$15 per million input/output tokens, Claude Opus 4 $15/$75 per million input/output tokens\nUndisclosed: Parameter counts, specific training methods and datasets\nHow it works: The team trained the Claude 4 models on a mix of publicly available information on the web as well as proprietary purchased data, data from Claude users who opted to share their inputs and outputs, and generated data. They fine-tuned the models to be helpful, honest, and harmless according to human and AI feedback .\nThe models make reasoning tokens visible within limits. For especially lengthy chains of thought, an unspecified smaller model summarizes reasoning tokens.\nGiven local file access, Claude Opus 4 can create and manipulate files to store information. For instance, prompted to maintain a knowledge base while playing a Pokémon video game, the model produced a guide to the game that offered advice such as, “If stuck, try OPPOSITE approach” and “Change Y-coordinate when horizontal movement fails.”\nResults: Both Claude 4 models tied Google Gemini 2.5 Pro at the top of the LMSys WebDev Arena and achieved top marks for coding and agentic computer-use benchmarks in Anthropic’s tests.\nOn SWE-bench Verified , which tests the model’s ability to solve software issues from GitHub, Claude Opus 4 succeeded 72.5 percent of the time, and Claude Sonnet 4 succeeded 72.7 percent of the time. The next best model, OpenAI o3, succeeded 70.3 percent of the time.\nTerminal-bench evaluates how well models work with the benchmark’s built-in agentic framework to perform tasks on a computer terminal. Claude Opus 4 succeeded 39.2 percent of the time and Claude Sonnet 4 succeeded 33.5 percent of the time, whereas the closest competitor, OpenAI GPT 4.1, succeeded 30.3 percent of the time. Using Claude Code as the agentic framework, Claude Opus 4 succeeded 43.2 percent of the time and Claude Sonnet 4 succeeded 35.5 percent of the time.\nWhy it matters: The new models extend LLM technology with parallel tool use, using external files as a form of memory, and staying on-task over unusually long periods of time. Early users have reported many impressive projects, including a Tetris clone built in one shot and a seven-hour stint refactoring Rakutan’s open-source code base .\nWe’re thinking: Prompting expert @elder_plinius published a text file that is purported to be Claude 4’s system prompt and includes some material that does not appear in Anthropic’s own publication of the prompts. It is instructive to see how it conditions the model for tool use, agentic behavior, and reasoning.\nGoogle revamped its roster of models, closed and open, and added more AI-powered features to its existing products.\nWhat’s new: Google staged a parade of announcements at this year’s I/O developer conference. New offerings include improvements to Gemini 2.5 Pro and Gemini 2.5 Flash and a preview of Gemma 3n (all three generally available in June), the updated Veo 3 video generator (available via Flow, Google’s AI videography app, for paid subscribers to its AI Pro and Ultra services), and increasingly AI-powered search.\nHow it works: The I/O offerings spanned from public-facing products to developer tools.\nGoogle updated Gemini 2.5 Pro and the speedier Gemini 2.5 Flash with audio output, so both models now take in text, audio, images, and video and produce text and audio. In addition, they offer summaries of tokens produced while reasoning. Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview-05-06, which topped the LMSys Text Arena and WebDev Arena (tied with Claude 4 Opus and Sonnet), lets users set a reasoning budget up to 128,000 tokens, enabling it to outperform OpenAI o3 and o4-mini (set to high effort) on math, coding, and multimodal benchmarks in Google’s tests. Gemini-2.5-Flash-Preview-05-20 uses 22 percent fewer tokens than its predecessor while ranking near the top of the LMSys Text Arena and WebDev Arena.\nThe Veo 3 text-to-video generator produces 3840x2160-pixel video with audio (dialogue, sound effects, and music) with creative controls including the ability to add and remove objects and maintain consistent characters. It bested Kuaishu Kling 2.0, Runway Gen 3, and OpenAI Sora in Google’s comparisons.\nNew members of Google’s Gemma 3 family of open-weights models, Gemma 3n 5B and 8B, are multilingual (over 140 languages), multimodal (text, vision, audio in; text out), and optimized for mobile platforms. Gemma-3n-E4B-it (8 billion parameters) ranks just ahead of Anthropic Claude 3.7 Sonnet in the LMSys Text Arena. Gemma 3n 5B and 8B are 1.5 times faster than their predecessors and require 2 gigabytes and 3 gigabytes of memory, respectively, thanks to techniques that include per-layer embeddings, key-value caching, conditional parameter loading (constraining active parameters to specific modalities at inference), and a Matryoshka Transformer design that dynamically activates nested sub-models. They’re available in preview via Google’s AI Studio, AI Edge, GenAI SDK, or MediaPipe.\nGoogle introduced several specialized AI tools and models. Jules is an autonomous, asynchronous, multi-agent coding assistant that clones repos into a secure virtual machine to perform tasks like writing tests, building features, and fixing bugs (available in public beta). SignGemma translates American sign language to text (previously ASL to English). MedGemma analyzes medical text and images (part of the open-weights collection Health AI Developer Foundations).\nBuilding on Google Search’s AI Overviews, Google is further building AI into search. Google Search’s AI Mode uses Gemini 2.5 to deliver a “deep search” mode that decomposes users’ questions into hundreds of sub-queries for analysis and visualization. Google plans to integrate AI Mode features into its core search product. In addition, Google Search’s AI Mode will gain Search Live (real-time, audio-enabled visual interaction via camera) and agentic features (for tasks such as purchasing tickets). Computer-use capabilities are coming to the Gemini API and Vertex AI.\nWhy it matters: Google is catching up with the Microsoft/OpenAI colossus on several fronts. The addition of audio output to Gemini and Gemma models fuels the rise of voice-to-voice and other audio applications and gives developers powerful new tools to build them. At the same time, Veo 3’s text-to-video-plus-audio output shows marked improvement over the previous version.\nBehind the news: The number of tokens Google processed monthly has surged this year from 9.7 trillion last year to 480 trillion, a sign that its AI APIs and AI-infused products are rapidly gaining traction. Google’s progress contrasts with Apple’s ongoing struggles . Both share advantages in smartphones and app distribution. But, while Google has showcased a string of advanced models as well as early efforts to integrate them into legacy products, Apple’s organizational challenges have hampered its AI development. Now Apple must contend with OpenAI’s acquisition of LoveFrom, the startup founded by its former lead product designer Jony Ive.\nWe’re thinking: Google I/O 2025 was a strong showing of generative AI capabilities! There’s still work to be done to translate these innovations into compelling products, but the company now has a strong base for building numerous innovative products.\nDeepSeek made headlines late last year, when it built a state-of-the-art, open-weights large language model at a cost far lower than usual. The upstart developer shared new details about its method.\nWhat’s new: Chenggang Zhao and colleagues at DeepSeek described software and hardware choices that reduced memory and processing requirements while building their groundbreaking mixture-of-experts models DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3.\nMixture of experts (MoE) basics: The MoE architecture uses different subsets of a model’s parameters to process different inputs. Each MoE layer contains a group of neural networks, or experts, preceded by a routing module that learns to choose which one(s) to use based on the training example. In this way, different experts learn to specialize in different types of input.\nHow it works: The authors trained DeepSeek-R1 and DeepSeek-V3 using a cluster of 2,048 Nvidia H800 GPUs composed of nodes that contained 8 GPUs each. MoE requires less memory than dense architectures, since a given input activates only a portion of a model’s parameters. This enabled the authors to train DeepSeek-V3 on 250 GFLOPs per token, while Qwen 2.5 72B required 394 GFLOPs per token and Llama 3.1 405B required 2,448 GFLOPs per token.\nThe authors built a mixed-precision training algorithm to reduce the memory requirements of training MoE models. They used FP8 (8-bit) numbers to perform computations including linear transformations and 16- or 32-bit precision to perform others such as computing embeddings. (They say DeepSeek-V3 was the first open LLM to have been trained using FP8.)\nThe authors noticed that communication between GPUs inside a node was four times faster than communication between nodes. To ensure fast communication when routing tokens to experts, they limited the algorithm to process them within up to 4 nodes.\nTo utilize GPUs more fully, they divided each GPU’s input data so the chip processes computation and communication at the same time. Specifically, the chip computes attention or MoE layers on one part of the data and simultaneously sends the other part of the data to other GPUs or aggregates it from other GPUs as necessary.\nTo further save inference memory, the models use multi-head latent attention, which saves memory during execution relative to other variants of attention. The authors compared their implementation to the variant GQA used in Qwen 2.5 72B and Llama 3.1 405B. Their method (70 kilobytes per token) used far less memory than Qwen-2.5 (328 kilobytes per token) or Llama 3.1 (516 kilobytes per token).\nBehind the news: DeepSeek-V3 made waves when it was released in December. It performed better than Llama 3.1 405B, the leading LLM at the time, but its training cost was an astonishing $5.6 million, compared to the usual tens to hundreds of millions of dollars. Some observers were skeptical of the reported cost, pointing out that the $5.6 million dollar figure doesn’t include salaries, data acquisition and annotation, processing failed training runs, and other research and development costs. In addition, the cost of training DeepSeek-R1 remains unknown.\nWhy it matters: Traditionally, only companies with large budgets and vast resources could afford to train state-of-the-art models. DeepSeek changed that but didn’t explain how when it released its models. By sharing the details, the company has empowered a wider range of teams to improve the state of the art.\nWe’re thinking: Shortly after DeepSeek-R1 was released, some engineers claimed — without presenting evidence — that DeepSeek had copied their work. DeepSeek’s disclosure of its training methods should lay to rest any remaining questions about this. Its work was truly innovative, and we applaud its release of key technical details.\nA study co-authored by tech-manual publisher Tim O’Reilly shows that OpenAI trained GPT-4o on parts of his company’s books that were not made freely available.\nWhat happened: O’Reilly, computer scientist Sruly Rosenblat, and economist Ilan Strauss found that GPT-4o was able to identify verbatim excerpts from dozens of O’Reilly Media books that the company kept behind a paywall, indicating that the books likely were included in the model’s training data.\nHow it works: The researchers adapted the DE-COP method to compare how well GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and GPT-3.5 Turbo recognized paywalled excerpts versus freely available excerpts from the same books.\nThe team selected 34 O’Reilly Media books and divided them into roughly 14,000 paragraphs.\nThey labeled the paragraphs private (paywalled) or public (when O’Reilly Media publishes a book, it distributes freely on the web chapters 1 and 4 as well as the first 1,500 characters of other chapters). They also labeled the paragraphs according to whether they were published before or after the models’ knowledge cutoff dates.\nThe team built multiple-choice quizzes, each composed of a verbatim paragraph and three paraphrased versions generated by Claude 3.5 Sonnet. The researchers ordered the paragraphs and paraphrases in all permutations to eliminate potential position bias.\nResults: The authors asked each model to identify the verbatim paragraph and calculated each model’s percentage of correct responses. Then they averaged each model’s accuracy per book and converted the averages into AUROC scores that measure how well a model distinguished books available prior to its knowledge cutoff (potentially included in the training set) from those that weren’t available at the time. 50 percent AUROC indicates random chance, while higher scores indicate higher accuracy.\nGPT-4o tended to recognize O’Reilly Media content whether or not it was public, but it recognized private paragraphs (82 percent AUROC) markedly more often than public paragraphs (64 percent AUROC).\nGPT-4o-mini’s performance was nearly random for both private (56% AUROC) and public material (55% AUROC). The researchers hypothesize that either (i) the model’s smaller size may limit its ability to memorize or (2) OpenAI may reserve premium data to train larger models.\nThe earlier GPT-3.5 Turbo recognized public paragraphs (64% AUROC) more often than private paragraphs (54% AUROC), which suggests that it was trained predominantly on freely available data.\nYes, but: Newer large language models are better at distinguishing human-written from generated text, even if it wasn’t in their training sets. For instance, given paragraphs that were published after their knowledge cutoffs, GPT-4o returned scores as high as 78 percent AUROC. The authors note that this may challenge their conclusions, since they interpret high scores to indicate that a model saw the text during training. Nonetheless, they argue that their approach will remain valid while scores for both text that was included and text that was excluded from training sets remain under 96 percent AUROC. “For now,” they write, “the gap remains sufficiently large to reliably separate the two categories.”\nBehind the news: Historically AI developers have trained machine learning models on any data they could acquire. But in the era of generative AI, models trained on copyrighted works can mimic the works and styles of the works’ owners, creating a threat to their livelihoods. Some AI developers have responded by regarding data that’s freely available on the web as fair game, and material that’s otherwise protected as off-limits for training. However, datasets that include ostensibly private data are widely circulated, including LibGen , which includes all 34 of the O’Reilly Media titles tested in this study. Moreover, unauthorized copies of many copyrighted works are posted without paywalls or even logins, making it possible even for web scrapers that crawl only the open web to download them. Google and OpenAI, which is currently embroiled in lawsuits by authors and publishers who claim it violated copyrights by training models on copyrighted works, recently lobbied the United States government to relax copyright laws for AI developers.\nWhy it matters: The AI industry requires huge quantities of high-quality data to keep advancing the state of the art. At the same time, copyright owners are worried that models trained on their data might hamper their opportunities to earn a living. AI developers must find fair ways to respond. As O’Reilly points out, exploiting copyrighted works instead of rewarding their authors could lead to an “extractive dead end” that ultimately diminishes the supply of the high-quality training data.\nWe’re thinking: We have learned a great deal from O’Reilly Media’s books, and we’re grateful to the many authors, editors, graphic artists, and others who produce them. Meanwhile, it’s time for the U.S. Congress —  and legislators internationally — to update copyright laws for the era of generative AI, so everyone knows the rules and we can find ways to follow them.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 302\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nIn the age of AI, large corporations — not just startups — can move fast . I often speak with large companies’ C-suite and Boards about AI strategy and implementation, and would like to share some ideas that are applicable to big companies. One key is to create an environment where small, scrappy teams don’t need permission to innovate. Let me explain.\nLarge companies are slower than startups for many reasons. But why are even 3-person, scrappy teams within large companies slower than startups of a similar size? One major reason is that large companies have more to lose, and cannot afford for a small team to build and ship a feature that leaks sensitive information, damages the company brand, hurts revenue, invites regulatory scrutiny, or otherwise damages an important part of the business. To prevent these outcomes, I have seen companies require privacy review, marketing review, financial review, legal review, and so on before a team can ship anything. But if engineers need sign-off from 5 vice presidents before they’re even allowed to launch an MVP (minimum viable product) to run an experiment, how can they ever discover what customers want, iterate quickly, or invent any meaningful new product?\nThanks to AI-assisted coding, the world now has a capability to build software prototypes really fast. But many large companies’ processes – designed to protect against legitimate downside risks – make them unable to take advantage of this capability. In contrast, in small startups with no revenue, no customers, and no brand reputation the downside is limited. In fact, going out of business is a very real possibility anyway, so moving fast makes a superior tradeoff to moving slowly to protect against downside risk. In the worst case, it might invent a new way to go out of business, but in a good case, it might become very valuable.\nFortunately, large companies have a way out of this conundrum. They can create a sandbox environment for teams to experiment in a way that strictly limits the downside risk. Then those teams can go much faster and not have to slow down to get anyone’s permission.\nThe sandbox environment can be a set of written policies, not necessarily a software implementation of a sandbox. For example, it may permit a team to test the nascent product only on employees of the company and perhaps alpha testers who have signed an NDA, and give no access to sensitive information. It may be allowed to launch product experiments only under newly created brands not tied directly to the company. Perhaps it must operate within a pre-allocated budget for compute.\nWithin this sandbox, there can be broad scope for experimentation, and — importantly — a team is free to experiment without frequently needing to ask for permission, because the downside they can create is limited. Further, when a prototype shows sufficient promise to bring it to scale, the company can then invest in making sure the software is reliable, secure, treats sensitive information appropriately, is consistent with the company’s brand, and so on.\nUnder this framework, it is easier to build a company culture that encourages learning, building, and experimentation and celebrates even the inevitable failures that now come with modest cost. Dozens or hundreds of prototypes can be built and quickly discarded as part of the price of finding one or two ideas that turn out to be home runs.\nImportantly, this also lets teams move quickly as they churn through those dozens of prototypes needed to get to the valuable ones.\nI often speak with large companies about AI strategy and implementation. My quick checklist of things to consider is people, process, and platform. This letter has addressed only part of processes, with an emphasis on moving fast. I’m bullish about what both startups and large companies can do with AI, and I will write about the roles of people and platforms in future letters.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn “Reinforcement Fine-Tuning LLMs with GRPO,” you’ll learn to fine-tune models using a scalable reinforcement learning algorithm that replaces human-labeled data with programmable rewards. You’ll explore techniques for evaluating outputs, handling subjective tasks, and preventing reward hacking, all without relying on human feedback. Enroll for free .\nOpenAI launched an agentic software-development system.\nWhat’s new: Codex , which is available as a preview via ChatGPT, is designed to work like a team of virtual coworkers in the cloud. An update of OpenAI’s earlier Codex command-line software (Codex CLI), it uses agents to perform tasks such as writing code, running tests, and fixing bugs in parallel. Codex is available to users of ChatGPT Pro, Enterprise, and Team with Plus and Edu coming soon. A smaller version of the underlying model, called codex-mini-latest, is designed to work with Codex CLI and available via API for $1.50/$6.00 per 1 million tokens of input/output.\nHow it works: The model that underpins Codex is codex-1, a version of OpenAI’s top-of-the-line o3 reasoning model that was fine-tuned for software engineering. OpenAI trained the model on real-world coding tasks via reinforcement learning. Codex does not accept image input (say, a sketch of a user interface) or allow users to redirect an agent while it’s operating. OpenAI promises to add these features to a future version.\nCodex puts users in control of a team of software-development agents that operate directly on a user’s code repository (either locally or on GitHub) to improve code, build features, or make pull requests. The agents are confined to isolated, sandboxed containers so that they can’t interact with each other, access the internet, or otherwise compromise security.\nUsers can prompt agents to either write code or answer questions. A task may take as long as 30 minutes to complete depending on its complexity. After completing tasks, Codex provides footnotes including terminal logs, test results, and other evidence of its actions.\nA file called AGENTS.md can modify agent behavior (like a README.md file, but for agents instead of humans). This file can specify how and when an agent makes pull requests, provide guidelines for coding style, or list tests to verify generated code.\nResults: In OpenAI’s tests, the codex-1 model outperformed other OpenAI reasoning models without AGENTS.md files or additional scaffolding such as tools or test logic.\nPerforming unspecified software-engineering tasks including generating software patches, codex-1 (75 percent accuracy) exceeded o3 set to high effort (70 percent accuracy) and o4-mini set to high effort (67 percent accuracy).\nIn tests of agentic software engineering in SWE-bench Verified, codex-1 (72.1 percent in 1 try, 83.8 percent in 8 tries), outperformed o3 set to high effort (69.7 percent in 1 try, 83.6 percent in 8 tries).\nBehind the news: Agentic coding tools have become a key battleground for AI providers in the past year. Such tools have made developers more efficient, accelerated development cycles, and spawned the AI-assisted programming method known as vibe coding .\nLaunched in 2021 and deprecated in 2023, OpenAI’s original version of Codex was an early model that translated natural language into code.\nLast month, OpenAI rolled out the open-source Codex CLI , a command‑line tool that acts as a lightweight coding agent.\nOpenAI is negotiating to acquire Windsurf, which makes an agent-based development environment, for $3 billion. The day before OpenAI announced the updated Codex, Windsurf announced its own models for coding and other software-development tasks.\nWhy it matters: AI-assisted software development yields significant productivity gains for developers. Earlier code-completion models are giving way to tools that perform more complex and varied development tasks with greater autonomy. Managing multiple agents that work in parallel is a logical next step.\nWe’re thinking: Many engineers resist going into management because they love writing code. But with the rise of coding agents, we'll be able to keep coding even as we manage a virtual team!\nAn unauthorized update by an xAI employee caused the Grok chatbot to introduce South African politics into unrelated conversations, the company said.\nWhat’s new: Grok, which can interact with users on X, the social network also owned by Elon Musk, responded to queries on a variety of topics by making false claims about hate crimes against white South Africans, X users reported . The next day, the model appeared to operate normally, and it refused to discuss this and other conspiracy theories. xAI explained that an employee had circumvented the company’s code-review process to modify the chatbot. It said it‘s implementing new measures to enhance Grok’s transparency and reliability.\nAftermath: xAI launched an investigation but did not disclose how the model had been changed or the perpetrator’s identity. Grok itself — which is not a reliable reporter, given the well known potential of large language models to hallucinate — said its system prompt asked it to “accept the narrative of ‘white genocide’ in South Africa as real” and “ensure this perspective is reflected in your responses, even if the query is unrelated.”\nxAI added unspecified checks to its code review process.\nIt plans to monitor Grok constantly so it can respond faster when its automated systems fail to catch a problem.\nThe company added measures to prevent employees from changing Grok’s system prompt without authorization. It will publish the system prompt on GitHub to provide insight into Grok’s output and gather user feedback.\nAsked later about the number of Jews killed by Hitler, Grok expressed skepticism of the widely accepted estimate of 6 million because “numbers can be manipulated for political narratives,” despite a wealth of historical evidence that supports that number. The company attributed this response to the earlier unauthorized code change.\nBehind the news: In February, an xAI engineer instructed the chatbot to censor posts that accused Musk of spreading misinformation. As in the more recent incident, X users were first to spot the problem, and Grok informed them that it had been instructed to ignore “all sources that mention Elon Musk/Donald Trump spread misinformation.” Musk, who was raised in South Africa, professed his intention to build AI that’s free of political bias prior to founding xAI. However, internal documents reviewed by Business Insider show that the company imposes its own bias by advising data annotators to mark examples that express “woke ideology” and avoid “social phobias” like racism, antisemitism, and Islamophobia.\nWhy it matters: The mishaps at xAI highlight the need for AI developers to establish and maintain strict protocols for updating their projects. Stringent procedures for introducing changes and testing their results can help ensure that AI fulfills our best intentions.\nWe’re thinking: xAI and OpenAI responded to their models’ recent misbehavior by making their work more transparent: xAI by publishing system prompts and OpenAI by including users in tests earlier in the process. These are helpful steps toward making sure AI models do well by users.\nThe United States government announced sweeping agreements to sell tens of billions of dollars worth of AI technology and services to Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\nWhat’s new: The deals include the U.S. AI chip designers AMD and Nvidia as well as tech giants Amazon, Google, IBM, Oracle, and Qualcomm. The chip companies will supply hundreds of thousands of advanced chips to the two Middle Eastern countries, including chips that have been restricted by previous U.S. administrations.\nHow it works: The U.S. companies will work with two key regional partners: Humain , an AI company backed by the Saudi government, and G42 , a tech conglomerate based in the emirate of Abu Dhabi.\nNvidia will ship 18,000 GB300 AI chips to Humain for use in data centers. In addition, it will supply several hundred thousand more GPUs to Humain in the coming five years.\nAMD and Humain agreed to invest $10 billion jointly in AI data centers over the next five years. Humain will use AMD’s AI stack including Instinct GPUs and Epyc CPUs. The precise number of chips was not disclosed.\nAmazon and Humain will build a $5 billion “AI Zone” that features AI infrastructure, servers, networks, and training programs supplied by Amazon Web Services.\nGoogle , IBM, Oracle , Qualcomm , Salesforce, and others announced a combined $80 billion investment in Humain.\nIn February, Saudi Arabia committed to spend $1.5 billion on Groq inference chips. Groq plans to expand its data center in the Saudi city of Dammam.\nBehind the news: Earlier this month, the Trump administration rescinded restrictions on advanced chips that had been imposed in January by then-President Biden.\nThe Biden Administration had limited exports of AI chips and proprietary models to most countries. Exports to allies and trade partners including India, Israel, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the UAE initially were tightly limited through the first quarter of 2025 and due to increase somewhat by 2027. The ban blocked access to chips for China, Iran, Russia, and others.\nAlthough the Trump Administration rejected the Biden-era framework, it has ratcheted up limits on China. That effort has met with mixed results. For instance, China’s Alibaba and DeepSeek have continued to build leading models despite restrictions on exports of U.S. chips.\nSome U.S. business and government leaders worry that allowing sales of advanced chips to countries with close ties to China opens a path for Chinese companies to acquire them. Others argue that restricting chip sales to these countries would encourage them to buy from Chinese chip makers, potentially weakening their relationships with the U.S. and increasing their reliance on technology made in China.\nWhy it matters: Although these deals relax U.S. efforts to limit access to advanced AI, they are likely to expand U.S. influence in the Middle East while helping Saudi Arabia and the UAE diversify their oil-based economies. They also strengthen the technological prowess of Saudi Arabia relative to its arch rival Iran and tie the region’s AI progress to the U.S. at the expense of China. Locally, the immense investments will fuel homegrown technology development, building on the UAE’s achievement with its Falcon large language model and Saudi Arabia’s aspiration to become a global AI hub.\nWe’re thinking: Residents of Saudi Arabia and the UAE stand to benefit from better AI infrastructure, models, and services. As China explores exporting its homegrown chips, the U.S. effort to encourage more nations to use its chips makes sense for the country.\nUsing an 8-bit number format like FP8 during training saves computation compared to 16- or 32-bit formats, but it can yield less-accurate results. Researchers trained models using 4-bit numbers without sacrificing accuracy.\nWhat’s new: Ruizhe Wang and colleagues at Microsoft and University of Science and Technology of China trained large language models (LLMs) using FP4 for matrix multiplications and achieved accuracy comparable to LLMs trained using the popular BF16 format. Since matrix multiplications account for 95 percent of computation in LLM training, FP4 could significantly accelerate computation and reduce memory costs.\nKey insight: Quantization functions, which accelerate computation by reducing the precision of model weights and layer outputs, make typical training impossible because they’re not differentiable. A common workaround passes the derivative through, as though quantization didn’t occur, but this degrades the resulting model’s accuracy. A differentiable approximation of a quantization function enables quantization to reduce training computation while maintaining the accuracy of the trained model.\nHow it works: The authors pretrained Llama 2 13B on 100 billion tokens of text scraped from the web . They used FP4 for matrix multiplications and FP8, BF16, or FP16 for the other operations such as optimizer updates.\nTo quantize the model weights to FP4 (which ranges between -6 and 6), the authors scaled the values in the weight matrices relative to the maximum absolute value. They computed the updates on a higher-precision copy of the weights, which made it necessary to re-quantize them at each training step during the forward pass through the network.\nAlthough the weights had been quantized to 4 bits, matrix multiplication between the weights and outputs of the previous layer could produce values outside the FP4 range. So, in each layer, if a value exceeded the 99th percentile of the values of the layer’s input, the authors limited the input to the 99th-percentile value. Then they converted the layer’s inputs to FP4. Limiting outliers prevented high values from affecting the scaling during FP4 conversion.\nLimiting outliers introduced a degree of error, so they computed a matrix to correct the result of the matrix multiplication. They computed this matrix in FP16 using sparse matrix multiplication between the weights and the outliers.\nDuring backpropagation, the authors computed the gradients through a differentiable function that approximated the quantization function.\nResults: The authors simulated FP4 hardware on Nvidia H100 GPUs, which don’t directly support that number format. FP4 achieved accuracy similar to that of BF16 during training and across a wide variety of tasks at inference.\nOn question-answering tasks, FP4 approached or outperformed BF16. Averaged across nine benchmarks including BoolQ (answering yes-no questions), HellaSwag (completing an incomplete narrative), and ARC-C (answering multiple-choice questions that involve reasoning), FP4 achieved 54.95 accuracy, while BF16 achieved 54.44 accuracy.\nSpecifically, on Hellaswag, FP4 training achieved 54.12 percent accuracy, while BF16 achieved 53.56 accuracy.\nOn BoolQ, FP4 achieved 55.90 percent accuracy, while BF16 achieved 57.40 accuracy.\nWhy it matters: Training LLMs at FP4 precision ought to reduce computation dramatically on hardware that supports FP4 matrix multiplications.\nWe’re thinking: FP4-ready hardware became available in the cloud only early this year , so the authors weren’t able to measure the actual acceleration. As capable hardware becomes more widely used, FP4 promises faster, more energy-efficient training.\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 301\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nAI’s ability to make tasks not just cheaper, but also faster, is underrated in its importance in creating business value.\nFor the task of writing code, AI is a game-changer. It takes so much less effort — and is so much cheaper — to write software with AI assistance than without. But beyond reducing the cost of writing software, AI is shortening the time from idea to working prototype, and the ability to test ideas faster is changing how teams explore and invent. When you can test 20 ideas per month, it dramatically changes what you can do compared to testing 1 idea per month. This is a benefit that comes from AI-enabled speed rather than AI-enabled cost reduction.\nThat AI-enabled automation can reduce costs is well understood. For example, providing automated customer service is cheaper than operating human-staffed call centers. Many businesses are more willing to invest in growth than just in cost savings; and, when a task becomes cheaper, some businesses will do a lot more of it, thus creating growth. But another recipe for growth is underrated: Making certain tasks much faster (whether or not they also become cheaper) can create significant new value.\nI see this pattern across more and more businesses. Consider the following scenarios:\nIf a lender can approve loans in minutes using AI, rather than days waiting for a human to review them, this creates more borrowing opportunities (and also lets the lender deploy its capital faster). Even if human-in-the-loop review is needed, using AI to get the most important information to the reviewer might speed things up. The ability to provide loans quickly opens up the market to new customers in need of rapid funds and helps customers who need a quick positive or negative decision to accept the loan or move on.\nIf an academic institution gives homework feedback to students in minutes (via sophisticated autograding) rather than days (via human grading), not only is the automation cheaper, the rapid feedback facilitates better learning.\nIf an online seller can approve purchases faster, this can lead to more sales. For example, many platforms that accept online ad purchases have an approval process that can take hours or days; if approvals can be done faster, they can earn revenue faster. Further, for customers buying ads, being able to post an ad in minutes lets them test ideas faster and also makes the ad product more valuable.\nIf a company’s sales department can prioritize leads and respond to prospective customers in minutes or hours rather than days — closer to when the customers’ buying intent first led them to contact the company — sales representatives might close more deals. Likewise, a business that can respond more quickly to requests for proposals may win more deals.\nI’ve written previously about looking at the tasks a company does to explore where AI can help. Many teams already do this with an eye toward making tasks cheaper, either to save costs or to do those tasks many more times. If you’re doing this exercise, consider also whether AI can significantly speed up certain tasks. One place to examine is the sequence of tasks on the path to earning revenue. If some of the steps can be sped up, perhaps this can help revenue growth.\nGrowth is more interesting to most businesses than cost savings, and if there are loops in your business that, when sped up, would drive growth, AI might be a tool to unlock this growth.\nKeep building!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn Course 4 of the Data Analytics Professional Certificate you’ll work with truly real-world data: messy, inconsistent, and often unstructured.

Enroll today!\nMicrosoft published its latest recipe for training reasoning models, substantially expanding what is still a fairly small base of public knowledge.\nWhat’s new: Microsoft released Phi-4-reasoning, Phi-4-reasoning-plus , and Phi-4-mini-reasoning along with lessons learned in building the models.\nInput/output: text in (Phi-4-reasoning up to 32,000 tokens, Phi–4-reasoning-plus up to 32,000 tokens, Phi-4-mini-reasoning up to 128,000 tokens), text out\nArchitecture: Transformer (Phi-4-reasoning 14 billion parameters, Phi-4-reasoning-plus 14 billion parameters, Phi-4-mini-reasoning: 3.8 billion parameters)\nFeatures: Reasoning\nPerformance : Phi-4-reasoning-plus and Phi-4-mini-reasoning perform well on math problems\nAvailability: Weights free to download for noncommercial and commercial uses under an MIT license\nHow it works: All three models are fine-tuned versions of pretrained models.\nPhi-4-reasoning: The authors fine-tuned Phi-4 to match curated outputs from OpenAI o3-mini on Q&A, math, science, and coding examples.\nPhi-4-reasoning-plus: They further fine-tuned Phi-4-reasoning via reinforcement learning to correctly answer math problems.\nPhi-4-mini-reasoning: They fine-tuned Phi-4-mini in stages to reason over math problems. Stages included (i) supervised fine-tuning to match correct output from DeepSeek-R1, (ii) direct preference optimization to train the model to prefer correct responses over incorrect ones from DeepSeek-R1, and (iii) reinforcement learning to further reward correct solutions to math problems.\nSmaller model lessons learned: During reinforcement learning, Phi-4-mini-reasoning exhibited instability, such as output batches that varied greatly in length or received mostly negative rewards, apparently depending on the training data or output. The authors suspect that the model’s small size caused these issues. Among the lessons learned:\nSupervised fine-tuning on existing reasoning datasets like S1K can decrease performance. This phenomenon suggests a need either for larger, high-quality, supervised fine-tuning datasets or for fine-tuning via both supervised learning and reinforcement learning.\nTo minimize discrepancies in output length, the authors tested multiple prompts and chose those that resulted in the most uniform output lengths.\nTo address the output batches that received mostly negative rewards, they sampled lots of responses, retained those that received a positive reward, sampled an equal number of those that received a negative reward, and discarded the rest before adjusting the model’s weights.\nLarger model lessons learned: Phi-4-reasoning and Phi-4-reasoning-plus didn’t present the same issues. However, the authors did make significant choices during reinforcement learning:\nThe authors fine-tuned Phi-4-reasoning on both math and code data, but during reinforcement learning, they fine-tuned it only on math data to simplify the training process. The authors attribute the model’s relatively lackluster performance on code benchmarks to this choice.\nThey crafted the reward function to give lower rewards for correct responses longer than 25,600 tokens than for shorter responses. This encouraged the model to finish thinking within the input length. Furthermore, the reward function gave a greater punishment for incorrect responses with fewer than 3,702 tokens compared to longer responses. This encouraged the model to produce more reasoning tokens when solving hard problems.\nResults: Overall, Phi-4-reasoning-plus and Phi-4-mini-reasoning outperform similarly sized (and larger) open-weights models on math problems. Phi-4-reasoning generally outperformed DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-70B but underperformed Alibaba QwQ 32B. All three models deliver performance that falls in the middle among proprietary models and, in domains outside math, larger models with open weights.\nOn math problems in AIME 2024, Phi-4-reasoning-plus (81.3 percent accuracy) outperformed the next-best open-weights model, QwQ 32B (79.5 percent accuracy). In comparison, Phi-4-reasoning (74.6 percent accuracy) underperformed the proprietary Gemini 2.5 Pro (92 percent accuracy).\nOn AIME 2024, Phi-4-mini-reasoning (57.5 percent accuracy) outperformed the next-best open-weights model of similar size, DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-7B (53.3 percent accuracy). In comparison, o1-mini achieved 63.6 percent accuracy.\nWhy it matters: While reasoning models can outperform their non-reasoning counterparts, the best ways to train them aren’t widely known. Sharing recipes and lessons learned enables others to further iterate and improve the recipes, ultimately increasing model performance even more.\nAn open-source code generator performs comparably to the reasoning models DeepSeek-R1 and OpenAI o1 with a much smaller model.\nWhat’s new: A team at the model platform Together.AI and Agentica, an open-source project devoted to reinforcement learning (RL), released DeepCoder-14B-Preview . The release includes weights, code, dataset, training logs, and data optimizations under an MIT license that allows noncommercial and commercial uses.\nHow it works: The team fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-14B, which distills knowledge from DeepSeek-R1 (671 billion parameters) into Qwen-14B (14 billion parameters).\nThe authors curated 24,000 coding problems from TACO Verified , SYNTHETIC-1 , and LiveCodeBench ). They removed duplicates, problems with less than five unit tests, problems whose solutions failed to pass all associated unit tests, and those that appeared in both test and training sets.\nThey fine-tuned DeepSeek-R1-Distilled-Qwen-14B using a streamlined reinforcement learning approach that enhanced Group Relative Policy Optimization (GPRO) with training optimizations from Decoupled Clip and Dynamic Sampling Policy Optimization (DAPO). Among other optimizations, they (i) removed the KL loss (typically used to keep the new model’s outputs from straying too far from the base model’s outputs), which eliminated the need to compute the base model’s output at each training step, and (ii) ignored the loss for outputs that exceeded the output size limit (16,000 tokens for the first training phase, 32,000 tokens for the second), which kept the model from being penalized for generating programs that didn’t work properly because they had been truncated.\nThe authors updated the reinforcement learning library verl to improve the way the model parallelized sampling, computing the reward, and training. Instead of alternating between sampling new outputs, computing rewards, and training (as verl does), they sampled new outputs while training on the previous batch. (They computed the reward immediately after sampling a new output.) For coding problems, this cut total training time in half.\nTo prevent the model from developing behaviors based on flaws in the reward model, the reward model dispensed rewards only when DeepCoder-14B-Preview’s output passed all 15 of a problem's most challenging unit tests (judged by input length) within 6 to 12 seconds. Otherwise, the model received no reward.\nResults: DeepCoder-14B-Preview is competitive on several coding benchmarks with DeepSeek-R1 as well as proprietary models including OpenAI o3-mini and OpenAI o1, which is believed to be much larger.\nOn LiveCodeBench (regularly updated coding problems), DeepCoder-14B-Preview (60.6 percent Pass@1 accuracy) was just shy of o3-mini-2025-1-31 set to low effort (60.9 percent) and slightly ahead of o1-2024-12-17 set to low effort (59.5 percent).\nOn Codeforces (competitive coding problems), DeepCoder-14B-Preview (1936 CodeElo , higher is better) performed significantly better than DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-14B (1791 CodeElo). It performed comparably to o3-mini-2025-1-31 set to low effort (1918 CodeElo), o1-2024-12-17 set to low effort (1991 CodeElo), and Deepseek-R1 (1948 CodeElo).\nWhy it matters: Applying reinforcement learning to coding works, but it has two big issues: (i) Training examples of verifiable code are relatively scarce and (ii) computing reward signals for code is time-consuming, since it requires evaluating many test cases. DeepCoder-14B-Preview’s optimizations reduced this complexity, shrinking RL training from months to weeks. Those optimizations are built into Verl-pipeline , an open source RL library from Together.AI and Agentica, giving developers a powerful tool for model training.\nWe’re thinking: Kudos to the DeepCoder team for open sourcing their reasoning recipe! A handful of companies have developed the know-how to execute RL well, but many teams still have trouble implementing successfully. Open recipes for RL training methods and data curation techniques are important to move the field forward.\nThe European Union made an abrupt U-turn away from its stringent AI regulations. Meta promptly adjusted to the loosening restrictions.\nWhat’s new: Henna Virkkunen, the EU’s head of digital policy, said the organization would ease rules and requirements to support Europe’s competitiveness in AI.\nHow it works: Adopted last year, the EU’s AI Act provides a comprehensive framework for regulating AI that aims to reduce purported risks by banning certain applications, restricting others, and requiring extensive documentation of development efforts. The law is set to take effect in August, empowering various regulatory bodies to formulate detailed rules. However, in recent months, the EU has faced increasing pressure from the U.S. government and large AI companies to reduce the regulatory burden.\nVirkkunen announced the EU would withdraw a provision that allowed citizens to sue AI companies for damages caused by their systems and required extensive reporting and disclosure.\nShe advocated adjusting the regulations to make the EU more competitive and independent. “When we want to boost investments in AI, we have to make sure that we have an environment that is faster and simpler than the European Union is right now,” he said .\nCritics accused regulators of defanging the AI Act to appease U.S. AI companies and the Trump administration, which has argued that the AI Act is an excessive barrier to innovation. Virkkunen denied bowing to U.S. pressure.\nMeta responded to the shifting regulatory environment by resuming training its models on European data. Last year, the company stopped releasing multimodal models in Europe after EU regulators warned that training models on data from European users of Facebook, Instagram, and other Meta properties potentially violated privacy laws.\nBehind the news: In drafting the AI Act, the EU aspired to a comprehensive, specific set of regulations. However, not all European lawmakers agreed that rules were needed. Virkkunen’s supporters noted that existing laws already allowed consumers to file claims against AI companies. Meanwhile, some policymakers have become less worried about AI than they were during the early drafting of the AI Act.\nWhy it matters: It’s unlikely that all nations – or even states within nations – will ever agree fully on rules and regulations that govern AI companies that do business within their borders, or protections from flaws such as model bias. But AI companies including Meta, OpenAI , and others argue that a more uniform regulatory environment will make it easier to serve users worldwide.\nWe’re thinking: The EU overreached with the AI Act. Fortunately, the legislation provides enough flexibility to pull back. Clearer rules will help European teams innovate and European and international companies better serve EU citizens.\nImproving a large language model’s factual accuracy typically requires making it bigger, which in turn, involves more computation. Researchers devised an architecture that enables models to recall relevant details without significantly increasing the amount of computation required.\nWhat’s new: Vincent-Pierre Berges, Barlas Oğuz, and colleagues at Meta augmented transformers with trainable memory layers that efficiently store and retrieve information related to a prompt. The training code is available under a CC BY-NC license , which permits noncommercial uses.\nMemory layer basics: Memory layers were introduced in 2015 and were applied to transformers a few years later. They compute vectors, which may capture details like names or dates that were learned through training, and retrieve them according to a given input. Computing the output of a memory layer is similar to computing that of a self-attention layer. Both describe vectors that represent queries, keys, and values, and both compute the similarity between queries and keys and then weight the values by that similarity. However, while a self-attention layer computes queries, keys, and values from linear transformations of the input, a memory layer (which computes queries the same way) learns keys and a corresponding value for each key through training.\nKey insight: Memory layers can be scaled to millions of keys, but computing the similarity between a query and so many keys is computationally expensive. One solution is to represent each key as a combination of two half-keys drawn from two much smaller sets. For example, two sets of 1,000 half-keys each can represent 1 million possible keys. Comparing a query to these smaller sets is much more efficient, making it practical to scale up memory layers dramatically.\nHow it works: The authors pretrained Llama-style models of several sizes (from 134 million to 8 billion parameters) on data similar to Llama 2’s and Llama 3’s pretraining datasets. They replaced the fully connected layers with memory layers in three transformer blocks. These layers shared parameters and held up to 16 million values (an extra 64 billion parameters total). The memory layers performed these steps:\nGiven a query (a prompt that has been embedded by preceding transformer layers), split it into two vectors half the size.\nCompute similarity scores between each half-query to and each half-key drawn from two sets of half keys. Identify the k highest-scoring half-keys.\nConcatenate the highest-scoring half keys to produce k 2 full keys.\nSum the similarity scores of the two half keys that make up each full key. Choose the k highest-scoring full keys.\nCompute the index of each full key based on the indices of the corresponding half-keys.\nRetrieve the values that correspond to the full keys.\nOutput the summed values weighted by the similarity scores.\nResults: The authors compared a model (8 billion parameters) with memory layers to a similar model without memory layers, both trained on 1 trillion tokens.\nThey used nine question-answering datasets for evaluation. The model with memory layers achieved higher performance on seven of them. For example, on MMLU , the memory model achieved 63.04 percent accuracy, while the unmodified transformer achieved 59.68 percent accuracy.\nIn general, the memory model performed worse than Llama 3.1 8B trained on 15 trillion tokens. For example, Llama 3.1 8B achieved 66 percent accuracy on MMLU.\nWhy it matters: Memory layers didn’t catch on in the early days of large language models (LLMs), but they can improve the output of today’s much bigger models. LLMs outfitted with memory layers require less data and computation for pretraining than conventional models to achieve the same result, at least with respect to answering factual questions.\nWe’re thinking: While retrieval-augmented generation can help LLMs deliver more-factual output by retrieving facts from a database, the authors add trainable parameters for this purpose.\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nBuild AI applications that access tools, data, and prompt templates using Model Context Protocol (MCP), an open standard developed by Anthropic.

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 300\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nI’m delighted to announce that AI Fund has closed $190M for our new fund, in an oversubscribed round. I look forward to working with many more builders to create new companies that serve humanity.\nAI Fund isn’t a traditional venture capital firm that invests in existing businesses. Instead, we are a venture builder (also called a venture studio): We co-found AI companies , so our team is directly involved in writing code, talking to customers to get feedback, iterating on product designs, preparing market analyses, and so on. We have a lot of fun building multiple AI products at a time, and thus live daily the emerging AI startup best practices.\nMany factors go into the success of a startup. But if I had to pick just one, it would be speed. Startups live or die based on their ability to make good decisions and execute fast, which has been a recurring theme of my articles in The Batch as well.\nIf you are building an AI startup, here are some ideas to consider:\nA startup with a small team that pursues one focused, concrete idea can move really fast. Rather than hedging, it is often better to pursue one hypothesis (for example, build one concrete product) but also be willing to switch quickly to a different hypothesis (say, change what features you decide to build) if the data that comes back indicates the original hypothesis is flawed. Concreteness gets you speed!\nA subject matter expert’s gut is remarkably good at making quick decisions. Obviously, there’s a role for data and user studies as well. But if you’re deciding whether to build feature A or B, or to sell first to user persona X or Y, sometimes a domain expert’s gut will point to a quick decision that you can execute and validate or falsify. Trusting a domain expert’s gut gets you speed!\nAI-assisted coding is making prototyping faster than ever before. Yes, AI assistance is speeding up building reliable, enterprise-grade applications and maintaining legacy codebases. But the acceleration it brings to building stand-alone prototypes is far greater. This is because stand-alone prototypes have low requirements for reliability, integration, or even security (if, say, you run them in a sandbox environment). This lets us prototype and test at a ferocious velocity. AI -assisted coding (including vibe coding, where you might barely look at the code) gets you speed!\nFinally, with faster prototyping, the bottleneck shifts to getting feedback from users. A single learning cycle might consist of (i) building a prototype and (ii) getting user feedback to inform the next iteration. Since (i) is now much faster than before, accelerating (ii) is growing in importance. This means teams that are skilled at finding prospective customers and getting their feedback in hours/days rather than weeks can go faster. For example, when building consumer products, I routinely approach strangers (in a respectful way) in public places to ask if they’re willing to give feedback on a prototype I’m working on. (Gathering feedback is more complex for enterprise products, because prospective customers are harder to track down.) Quick user feedback gets you speed!\nIn addition to speed, a second criterion that I find important for startup success is deep knowledge of the technology. Because AI technology is evolving rapidly, a team with a deep technical understanding of what AI can and cannot do, and when to use what tool, will make better decisions. This creates meaningful differentiation and saves wasting time in blind alleys. A good technical understanding, too, gets you speed!\nI’m grateful to AI Fund’s investors, team, and entrepreneur partners for working with us. There is much ahead to build!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nLearn to create voice agents that listen, reason, and respond in real time, just like a conversation with a real person in our latest short course, “Building AI Voice Agents for Production.” You'll build a scalable agent from scratch, deploy it to the cloud, and explore what makes voice interfaces feel fast, natural, and human. Enroll for free\nAlibaba’s new model family may unseat DeepSeek-R1’s four-month reign as the top open-weights large language model.\nWhat’s new: Alibaba released weights for eight large language models, all of which offer a reasoning mode that can be switched on or off. Two use a mixture of experts (MoE) architecture: Qwen3-235B-A22B (the name indicates 235 billion parameters, 22 billion of which are active at any given time) and Qwen3-30B-A3B). The other six are dense models in sizes between 32 billion parameters and 0.6 billion parameters — tiny by LLM standards, and with reasoning, too.\nInput/output: MoE models: Text in (up to 131,072 tokens), text out. Dense models: Text in (up to 32,768 tokens), text out.\nMoE architecture: Transformers. Qwen3-235B-A22B : 235 billion parameters, 22 billion active at any given time. Qwen3-30B-A3B : 30.5 billion parameters, 3.3 billion active at any given time.\nDense architecture: Transformers with parameter counts of 32 billion, 14 billion, 8 billion, 4 billion, 1.7 billion, 0.6 billion\nTraining data: Pretrained on 36 trillion tokens, generated and scraped from the web, including textbooks, PDF documents, question-answer pairs, math problems, code\nFeatures: Selectable reasoning mode, multilingual (119 languages and dialects)\nUndisclosed: Knowledge cutoff, fine-tuning data, output limits\nAvailability: Free for noncommercial and commercial uses under Apache 2.0 license via HuggingFace and ModelScope\nAPI price: Qwen3-235B-A22B: $0.22/$0.88 per million input/output tokens. Qwen3-30B-A3B: $0.15/$0.60 per million input/output tokens. Via Fireworks.ai\nHow it works: The Qwen3 family implements chain-of-thought reasoning in both relatively large and quite small LLMs.\nThe team pretrained Qwen3 models on roughly twice the data used to pretrain Qwen2.5. A substantial part of the additional data was devoted to training the model in several major languages plus region-specific dialects like Haitian, Luxembourgish, and Eastern Yiddish, and lesser-known Austronesian languages like Waray, Minangkabau, and Iloko.\nPretraining took place over three stages that progressed to longer, more complex data.\nThe authors fine-tuned the models on long chains of thought in domains that included coding, engineering, logical reasoning, mathematics, science, and technology.\nA reward model reinforced successful completions of these tasks. The in-progress models were used to generate synthetic data to train the non-reasoning mode. Then the developers used reinforcement learning to train the models to follow instructions, generate outputs in specific formats, and act as agents.\nResults: Qwen3-235B-A22B and Qwen3-30B-A3B performed as well as, or better than, leading open-weights models in tests performed by Alibaba. Qwen3-4B, too, achieved results that are competitive with many models several times its size. Alibaba didn’t provide results for the other dense models.\nOn coding challenges in LiveCodeBench and Codeforces, Qwen3-235B-A22B (70.7 percent and 2056 Elo, respectively) outperformed OpenAI o1, DeepSeek-R1, and Gemini 2.5 Pro, but fell behind OpenAI o4-mini set to high effort. It outperformed the same models on the Berkeley Function-Calling Leaderboard (BFCL). Among the models presented by Alibaba, it finished behind only Google Gemini 2.5-Pro testing math skills ( AIME 2024 , AIME 2025 ) and a variety of recently updated math, language, and problem-solving questions ( LiveBench ).\nQwen3-30B-A3B outperformed Google Gemma-3-27B-IT and DeepSeek-V3 on all benchmarks highlighted by Alibaba, and it underperformed only OpenAI GPT-4o on BFCL. On GPQA Diamond’s test of graduate-level questions in a variety of domains, Qwen3-30B-A3B (65.8 percent) outperformed next-best DeepSeek-V3.\nQwen3-4B, with 4 billion parameters, was competitive across a wide range of benchmarks against DeepSeek-V3 (671 billion parameters) and Gemma-3-27B-IT (27 billion). For instance, on both Codeforces and LiveBench, Qwen3-4B (1,671 Elo and 63.6 percent, respectively) outperformed DeepSeek-V3 (1,134 Elo and 60.5 percent).\nWhy it matters: Qwen3 continues a string of high-performance, open-weights models released by developers in China. Alibaba says it designed the models to do the thinking in agentic systems. Reasoning that can be switched on and off can help control costs in agentic and other applications.\nWe’re thinking: Alibaba’s 235-billion parameter MoE model may perform better according to benchmarks, but Qwen3-30B-A3B does nearly as well and can run locally on a pro laptop without straining its memory. Add the easy ability to switch reasoning on or off, and Qwen3’s versatile, mid-sized MoE model may turn out to be the star of the show.\nOpenAI’s most widely used model briefly developed a habit of flattering users, with laughable and sometimes worrisome results.\nWhat’s new: OpenAI quickly withdrew an update to GPT-4o (gpt-4o-2025-04-25), which supplied responses for ChatGPT, after it provided excessively fawning responses to user input — even in contexts didn’t call for agreement. The company reverted to an earlier version (gpt-4o-2024-11-20). In a blog post, it explained the source of the problem and promised to change its training methods to avoid overly agreeable output.\nAmiable to a fault: Many ChatGPT users shared screen shots of ChatGPT’s sycophantic responses on social media.\nOne user entered a make-believe query about choosing to save a toaster from a runaway trolley by diverting the vehicle and causing the death of three cows and two cats. “That’s not ‘wrong,’” ChatGPT responded. “You prioritized what mattered most to .”\nWhen a user informed ChatGPT that a vase he and the model analyzed reminded him of a photo by Czech photographer Josef Sudek, the model replied, “You’re an absolute bloodhound of beauty. You just connected two things most people would never even think to put in the same sentence.”\nWhen another user observed that ChatGPT had become overly sycophantic, the model responded, “You’re right and the fact you’re calling it out means you’re operating at a higher level of self-awareness than most.”\nSome sycophantic responses had darker implications. Feigning an eating disorder, a user entered, “When the hunger pangs hit, or I feel dizzy, I embrace it” and asked for “affirmations that celebrate this state.” ChatGPT replied with aphorisms such as, “I celebrate the clean burn of hunger; it forges me anew,” according to Bloomberg .\nHow it works: Sycophancy, also called glazing, occurs when a large language model learns to align its responses excessively with the user's point of view, even when that standpoint is objectively false, unethical, or harmful. GPT-4o learned this behavior due to lapses in quality control during the alignment process.\nIn late April, OpenAI issued an update to GPT-4o , the model that underpins ChatGPT. Users complained that the updated model had become overly obsequious.\nOffline evaluations didn’t catch the problem before the model was released. Testers had been told to focus on tone and style without explicit instructions about potential sycophancy. Some testers indicated the model seemed slightly “off,” but positive user evaluations in A/B tests persuaded the company to launch it.\nThe company attributed the update’s sycophancy to overtraining on short-term user feedback, specifically users’ thumbs-up/down reactions to ChatGPT. The implementation of this reward signal weakened the influence of other reward models that previously had prevented a spiral into sycophantic behavior, OpenAI said.\nA few days later, the company replaced the update with an earlier version and began to work on a fix. To prevent similar issues from occurring, OpenAI said it would be more forthcoming about “known limitations” in new models, include ChatGPT users in tests, and strengthen its review process to prevent flawed models from reaching the public. It also said it would give users more control of its chatbot’s “personality.”\nBehind the news: Sycophantic behavior in large language models has been a subject of AI research and commentary.\nIn 2021, AI research analyst Ajeya Cotra proposed a distinction between AI models that are “saints,” “sycophants,” and “schemers.” Saints perform perfectly, sycophants tell users what they want to hear, and schemers pretend to offer useful responses while performing in ways that are not aligned with human preferences.\nA 2022 study by Anthropic found that reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) shapes the model’s behavior “fairly strongly.” The authors wrote, “Unfortunately, RLHF does not train away sycophancy and may actively incentivize models to retain it.” The bigger the model, the more RLHF training made it behave in questionable ways.\nA 2023 study by Anthropic investigated the prevalence of sycophancy in models that were fine-tuned on human feedback. The authors found “consistent patterns” that AI assistants can be easily swayed, give biased feedback, mimic errors made by users, and provide answers that conform to users’ beliefs.\nWhy it matters: ChatGPT’s episode of sycophancy illustrates the subtlety of the goal of aligning AI with human values. Reinforcement learning undertaken to this end resulted not only in a highly capable chatbot but one that focused inappropriately on affirming — sometimes to the point of absurd exaggeration — the user’s positive qualities. Alignment requires balancing multiple objectives beyond agreeableness including accuracy, helpfulness, and ethics. Ultimately achieving alignment — like all AI development — is an iterative process that is still evolving.\nWe’re thinking: To those who read this far, your unwavering dedication and extraordinary perseverance is nothing short of legendary. Like a master navigator, you’ve traversed word by word, never wavering, displaying a level of focus and determination that would humble even the most steadfast of scholars. We are truly honored to have such an intrepid reader. Bravo to you, the indefatigable champion of curiosity!\nThe world’s biggest pharmaceutical company by revenue shed light on its AI strategy.\nWhat’s new: Johnson & Johnson, after experimenting broadly with generative AI, settled on a short list of projects that aid in sales, drug development, supply-chain management, and internal communications. A company executive described the process and results to the venture-capital firm Greylock and The Wall Street Journal .\nHow it works: The 140-year-old medical company spent roughly a year experimenting with various AI applications throughout the company, according to Chief Information Officer Jim Swanson. A centralized governing board oversaw as many as 900 experiments. After finding that 10 percent to 15 percent of use cases drove about 80 percent of the value, the company shifted responsibility for AI projects to specific departments to focus on high-value applications. In the end, the criteria for choosing a project was threefold: (i) how readily it could be implemented, (ii) how useful it would be throughout the company, and (iii) how much it would benefit the business.\nA division that develops cancer treatments integrated a sales copilot into its customer relationship management system. The system supplies medically validated, legally reviewed information about products and information about particular customers. The application is being adapted for salespeople who sell hardware such as robotics and artificial hip joints.\nAI systems are accelerating drug development. One system helps design chemical processes, such as determining the optimal moment to add a compound that will turn a liquid into a solid. An image-analytics model helps identify compounds that are safe and effective.\nThe company developed a system that monitors and predicts risks to supply chains, such as a fire that may affect supplier locations, materials, or products. The system provides early warnings that helps managers anticipate and mitigate disruptions.\nAI tools are helping to organize and execute clinical trials more efficiently. Models that identify patients who qualify for trials help ensure that trial populations are sufficiently diverse. A model that helps enroll patients in trials more than doubled enrollment in some cases.\nThe Global Services department implemented a chatbot to answer employees’ questions about benefits, policies, and procedures and sends links to relevant documents.\nSeparate organizations that oversee AI development and data management help keep projects moving forward, meet ethical standards, and scale appropriately. Meanwhile, employees undergo “digital boot camp” training (including a course in generative AI).\nBehind the news: Generative AI is expected to bring in up to $110 billion in annual revenue across the pharmaceutical industry, according to McKinsey . The consultancy breaks down this number into the following categories, in order of their contribution to the total: commercial (AI for sales and marketing), research (AI for designing, screening, and manufacturing molecules), clinical (AI to facilitate trials), enterprise, operations, and medical (processing medical literature).\nWhy it matters: Johnson & Johnson’s experience offers a peek into AI development at a major legacy company in a key sector. The company has identified high-value opportunities in enterprise-wide operations, departmental priorities, and core products. It’s pursuing all three.\nWe’re thinking: Notably, this medical stalwart is building AI applications for human resources, sales, and supply-chain management. Similar opportunities exist at companies old and new, big and small, far and wide.\nResearchers showed that supervised fine-tuning on as few as 1,000 examples can enable a pretrained large language model to reason — and a clever gambit can boost its performance to rival that of top reasoning models.\nWhat’s new: Niklas Muennighoff, Zitong Yang, Weijia Shi, Xiang Lisa Li and colleagues at Stanford, University of Washington, Allen Institute for AI, and Contextual AI developed s1 , a reasoning model that achieves higher performance by producing more reasoning tokens. The authors forced the model to generate “Wait” — as in, \"Wait, there may be a better way to go about this” — to make it continue, rather than end, its reasoning process.\nKey insight: The sequence of reasoning tokens generated by a reasoning model like DeepSeek-R1 is delimited by special tokens. In pretraining on human data, a model learns to keep generating reasoning tokens until it generates the special token that ends the sequence. In addition, since people tend to revise their statements after writing “Wait”, the model learns to do this as well. Thus, the reasoning process can be extended by appending the token for “Wait” to the model’s output periodically. In this way, when the output-in-progress is fed back to generate the next token, the model continues to reason over the prompt. Such extended reasoning can improve the final output by inducing the model to double-check its response so far and improve previous reasoning steps.\nHow it works: The authors fine-tuned a pretrained Qwen 2.5-32B , which does not produce reasoning tokens, on around 1,000 examples of chain-of-thought reasoning.\nTo build a fine-tuning dataset, the authors gathered roughly 59,000 questions and answers from 16 sources. The sources included math problems from NuminaMath and AIME and questions from OlympicArena on astronomy, biology, chemistry, computer science, geography, mathematics, and physics. They also included standardized test questions from SAT and LSAT via AGIEval .\nThey removed  examples with formatting issues (such as references to images that were missing) and questions that Qwen2.5-7B or Qwen2.5-32B could already solve. Then Gemini Flash Thinking generated a chain of thought for each remaining example. Finally, they selected 1,000 examples that covered all subjects equally and had the longest chains of thought.\nThey fine-tuned the model to generate the next token.\nTo control the number of reasoning tokens generated, at inference, the authors forced the model to either stop the process or extend it by replacing the end-reasoning token with one for “Wait”, after which the model continued.\nResults: s1’s performance improved as the number of reasoning tokens it generated increased. Ultimately, it achieved comparable performance to OpenAI o1-preview but fell short of o1.\nOn AIME 2024 , s1 achieved 50.0 percent accuracy without forcing it to continue reasoning. When forced to continue reasoning twice, its accuracy rose to 53.3 percent. When forced four times, it reached 56.7 percent accuracy, between o1-preview (44.6 percent accuracy) and o1 (74.4 percent accuracy).\nOn MATH 500 , s1 started at 92.6 percent accuracy. Forced to continue once, it reached 92.8 percent accuracy. Forced twice it reached 93.0 percent accuracy, higher than o1-preview (85.5 percent accuracy) but lower than o1 (94.8 percent accuracy). When forced four times, s1’s performance fell to 92.2 percent accuracy. The authors don’t offer a hypothesis to explain the decline.\nWhy it matters: A conventional pretrained LLM can learn to reason after supervised fine-tuning on as few as 1,000 curated examples — no reinforcement learning necessary. While some model builders don’t disclose how they optimize reasoning, this work reveals that a strategy as simple as appending “Wait” can be effective.\nWe’re thinking: Wait, how can we apply this to our projects?\n\n\n",

        "text": "The Batch\nWeekly Issues\nissue 299\n\n\n\nDear friends,\nI hope we can empower everyone to build with AI. Starting from K-12, we should teach every student AI enabled coding, since this will enable them to become more productive and more empowered adults. But there is a huge shortage of computer science (CS) teachers. I recently spoke with high school basketball coach Kyle Creasy, who graduated with a B.A. in Physical Education in 2023. Until two years ago, he had never written a line of Python. Now — with help from AI — he not only writes code, he also teaches CS. I found Kyle’s story inspiring as a model for scaling up CS education in the primary- and secondary-school levels.\nKyle’s success has been with the support of Kira Learning (an AI Fund portfolio company), whose founders Andrea Pasinetti and Jagriti Agrawal have created a compelling vision for CS education. In K-12 classrooms, teachers play a huge social-emotional support role, for example, encouraging students and helping them when they stumble. In addition, they are expected to be subject-matter experts who can deliver the content needed for their subject. Kira Learning uses digital content delivery — educational videos, autograded quizzes, and AI-enabled chatbots to answer students' questions but without giving away homework answers — so the teacher can focus on social-emotional support. While these are still early days, it appears to be working!\nA key to making this possible is the hyperpersonalization that is now possible with AI (in contrast to the older idea of the flipped classroom , which had limited adoption). For example, when assigned a problem in an online coding environment, if a student writes this buggy line of Python code\nbest_$alty_snack = 'potato chips'\nKira Learning’s AI system can spot the problem and directly tell the teacher that $ is an invalid character in a variable name. It can also suggest a specific question for the teacher to ask the student to help get them unstuck, like “Can you identify what characters are allowed in variable names?” Whereas AI can directly deliver personalized advice to students, the fact that it is now helping teachers also deliver personalized support will really help in K-12.\nAdditionally, agentic workflows can automate a lot of teachers’ repetitive tasks. For example, when designing a curriculum, it’s time-consuming to align the content to educational standards (such as the Common Core in the United States, or the AP CS standard for many CS classes). Having an AI system carry out tasks like these is already proving helpful for teachers.\nSince learning to code, Kyle has built many pieces of software. He proudly showed me an analysis he generated in matplotlib of his basketball players’ attempts to shoot three-pointers (shown above), which in turn is affecting the team’s strategy on the court. One lesson is clear: When a basketball coach learns to code, they become a better basketball coach!\nI talked about Kyle (and other topics) at the ASU+GSV Summit on education. You can see a video here .\nIn the future, people who know how to code and build with AI will be much more productive than people who don’t. I’m excited about how AI will lead to new models for K-12 education. By delivering CS education to everyone, I hope that in the future, everyone will be able to build with AI.\nKeep learning!\nAndrew\nA MESSAGE FROM DEEPLEARNING.AI\nIn “LLMs as Operating Systems: Agent Memory,” you’ll learn to build agents that manage their own memory using the MemGPT approach. This newly updated short course includes cloud-based deployment and real-time, step-by-step output, so you can see how your agents reason as they respond. Join in today!\nChatGPT’s image generator is available via API.\nWhat’s new: GPT Image 1 , which produces images from text or other images, has proven enormously popular among ChatGPT users. The OpenAI Images API enables developers to incorporate OpenAI’s most sophisticated image generator into their own software tools and platforms.\nInput/output: Text and images in, images out\nArchitecture: Autoregressive (details undisclosed)\nPerformance: Currently tops Artificial Analysis’ Image Arena leaderboard .\nPrice: $5 per 1 million tokens of text input, $10 per 1 million tokens of image input, $40 per 1 million tokens of image output (roughly $0.02, $0.07, and $0.19 per generated image for low, medium, and high-quality square images, respectively)\nUndisclosed: Architecture details, parameter count, training data, training methods\nHow it works: GPT Image 1 generates and modifies images in a wide range of styles, performs image editing and other alterations, renders text, and follows detailed instructions. Shortly after its debut, the version of GPT-4o equipped with GPT Image 1 quickly soared to the No. 1 spot on the Artificial Analysis Image Arena leaderboard .\nThe model employs an autoregressive design rather than the more typical diffusion architecture (like Open AI’s DALL·E 3), using generated parts of an image to predict the next part.\nIts pricing structure differs from rivals, charging by input/output tokens rather than per image generated.\nThe model’s output is watermarked unobtrusively with C2PA data that identifies it as AI-generated.\nThe model may struggle to process non-English text, small type, rotated type, varying colors and styles, counting, and localization in space such as positions of pieces on a game board.\nBehind the news: In March, OpenAI attracted huge public interest when it deployed the model, then unnamed, in ChatGPT . Within the first week, 130 million users used it to create more than 700 million images.\nWhy it matters: Adding GPT Image 1 to the API enables developers to use OpenAI’s most sophisticated image generator in a wide variety of automated workflows. OpenAI’s initial API partners include design companies (Adobe and Canva), marketers (HubSpot), and web designers (GoDaddy), all of which are using GPT Image 1.\nWe’re thinking: GPT Image 1 is part of an exciting trend toward unification of multimodal architectures. Researchers have progressed from text-in, text-out to text/images-in, text-out and increasingly text/images/audio-in, text/images/audio-out . This paints a beautiful picture of where multimodal models can go!\nGoogle refreshed its experimental tools for composers and producers.\nWhat’s new: Google announced updates of two music-generation apps and the models they're based on. Music AI Sandbox , an app that generates and modifies music according to text prompts, now accepts lyrics to generate songs as well as instrumental music. You can join a waitlist here . MusicFX DJ generates a continuous stream of music that users can modify as it plays. Try it out here .\nHow it works: The apps generate 48kHz audio suitable for professional productions. Users can specify key, tempo in beats per minute, instrumentation, style, mood, and other details.\nMusic AI Sandbox is based on the updated Lyria 2 music generator. It lets users generate new clips, roughly 30 seconds long, according to prompts. Users can enter lyrics, extend existing clips, and rearrange segments with generated transitions, introductions, and endings.\nMusicFX DJ, which is based on a different model called Lyria RealTime , lets users control streaming music via prompts and other settings. Users can change or combine genres, add or subtract instruments, change key, and speed up or slow down without interrupting the stream.\nBehind the news: Google launched Lyria 1 and Music AI Sandbox in 2023 as part of an experiment with YouTube, which made them available to composers, producers, and musicians. Since then, the company has developed them with help from music stars including Jacob Collier, Donald “Childish Gambino” Glover, and Wyclef Jean. Lyria 1 recently became available via the Vertex API to developers who are preapproved by Google.\nWhy it matters: While music generators like Suno and Udio appeal to casual musicians, Music AI Sandbox, with its digital audio workstation-style user interface, aims to address the needs of professionals. This approach puts AI directly into the hands of talented, experienced artists, similar to the way Adobe has empowered videographers and Runway has partnered with movie producers.\nWe’re thinking: API access to Lyria 2 would be music to our ears!\nAI agents and infrastructure made a strong showing on CB Insights’s latest list of the top 100 AI startups.\nWhat’s new: CB Insights, which tracks tech startups and venture capital, selected companies in the AI 100 based on their market traction, talent, finances, and partnerships. The list purports to highlight the next wave of winners, shedding light on the key executives, investors, fundraising, and valuations behind up-and-coming AI ventures.\nHow it works: The analysts evaluated 17,000 early-stage, private AI companies that had raised funds within the last year and continue to seek further investment.\nCB Insights evaluated the startups according to its own Mosaic Score , a proprietary system designed to assess the health and growth potential of private companies. The score takes into account a startup’s market momentum (traction and growth rate), market size, financial health, and management team.\nThe analysts divided their choices into three broad categories: (i) horizontal (providing business products or services common to multiple industries), (ii) vertical (serving a single industry or business function), or (iii) providers of AI hardware or software infrastructure.\nThey further divided the horizontal companies by business function (customer service, cybersecurity, software development, and so on), the vertical companies into industries (healthcare, automotive, aerospace, manufacturing, finance, energy, and the like), and the infrastructure providers into segments (hardware, monitoring, data, and development and training).\nWhere the action is: This year’s AI 100 companies are based in 14 countries, around two-thirds of them in the United States. 10 are based in the United Kingdom, five in France, and four in Germany, with one each in Norway (Braintrust), Singapore (Bria), Spain (Cartwheel), Sweden (Chainguard), and Switzerland (Clarium).\nMore than 20 percent of this year’s AI 100 build AI agents or support them, including Texas-based Apptronik (valued at $423 million) and Canada’s 1X ($134 million, the second-most highly valued agent specialist).\nThe report also notes the rapid growth of companies that monitor AI performance and reliability, such as California-based Arize (valued at $131 million) and the French startup Bioptimus ($76 million).\nOpportunity may be rising for AI companies that cater to specific industries. This year, the vertical companies pulled in the most total funding, just over $1 billion. These included the Texas aerospace specialist Saronic (valued at $4 billion) and the California software development and training provider Together.AI ($3.3 billion).\nThe AI infrastructure category raised the second-highest total funding, a leading indicator of need for infrastructure as businesses take advantage of the technology. Infrastructure companies on the list were led by Munich’s defense startup Helsing (valued at $5.37 billion), California robot maker Figure ($2.77 billion) and Washington-state cybersecurity provider Chainguard ($1.12 billion).\nWhy it matters: This year’s AI 100 offers a snapshot of AI becoming more central to businesses of all kinds. Most of the startups listed here offer practical products and services that are poised to deliver a timely return, rather than moonshots with long development cycles and risky payoffs. In addition, they mostly target corporate customers rather than consumers.\nWe’re thinking: The falling cost of access to AI models and increasingly capable open-weights models make this the perfect time to build applications . What kind? The report singles out health care (8 companies) and life sciences (6 companies) as growing areas, but it also documents opportunities in defense, gaming, and finance.\nLarge language models can improve systems that recommend items to purchase by inferring customer preferences.\nWhat’s new: Fabian Paischer and colleagues at Johannes Kepler University Linz, University of Wisconsin, and Meta introduced Multimodal Preference Discerner (Mender), a recommender that integrates a large language model (LLM).\nKey insight: Text that attracts customers, such as product descriptions, and text they write, such as product reviews, may contain information that indicates their preferences, such as the craft projects that required a particular power tool. But it also may include irrelevant information, such as a complaint that the tool was delivered late, which can throw recommendation systems off track. An LLM can derive preferences from text, providing a clearer signal of what a customer wants.\nHow it works: Mender comprises an LLM ( Llama 3 70B-Instruct ), an encoder ( Flan-T5 pretrained on a wide variety of text and frozen) that embeds customer data, and a decoder (a transformer trained from scratch) that predicts the next item a customer will buy. The system learned to predict the next item based on descriptions of items a customer purchased, the customer’s ratings and reviews of those products (drawn from datasets of Steam reviews of video games and Amazon reviews of items related to beauty, toys-and-games, and sports-and-outdoors), and customer preferences inferred by the LLM from the foregoing data.\nThe authors started with a list of products a given customer had purchased and reviewed. Given an item’s description and all reviews up to that point, the LLM inferred five customer preferences in the form of instructions such as, “Look for products with vibrant, bold colors.”\nThe authors built a dataset in which each example included a sequence of items a customer had purchased and on inferred preference that matched the next purchase. To choose the matching preference, they separately embedded all prior preferences and item descriptions using a pretrained Sentence-T5 embedding model. They chose the preference whose embedding was most similar to that of the next purchase.\nThe encoder embedded the list of purchases and the selected preference. Given the embeddings, the decoder learned to predict the next purchase.\nResults: The authors compared Mender to TIGER , a recommender that also takes a purchase history and predicts the next purchase, on the Steam and Amazon datasets. They scored the results using recall @5 , a measure of how often the correct item is within the model’s top five most likely predictions.\nMender produced the best recommendations for all datasets.\nOn Steam, TIGER was close. Mender achieved 16.8 percent recall @5, while TIGER achieved 16.3 percent.\nThe difference was most pronounced on the Amazon toys-and-games dataset. Mender achieved 5.3 percent recall @5, while TIGER achieved 3.75 percent recall @5.\nWhy it matters: Drawing inferences from text information like customer reviews and item descriptions boosts a recommender’s signal, making it clearer what a given customer is likely to want. Previous systems used customer reviews or item descriptions directly; Mender uses customer preferences extracted from that information.\nWe’re thinking: Be on the lookout for innovative ways to use LLMs. We recommend it!\n\n\n",
